EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer and Lisa walk out of the house.  ``You're welcome, Bart!''
Homer walks into the kitchen where Bart sits eating breakfast.  ``Hey, look at this!  I've got
 something that looks like an American boy's butt.''  Bart opens the packet.  ``Oh...I don't know.''

 The family go inside to see what they can buy for dinner.
 Ned comes in and tells them about his new toy, a miniature version of his old one.  He
 imagines himself in Homer's old man's body and gives him a
 massage.  ``My old man has a little thing on his mind, but he'll just have to learn how to make it work.''

 At home, the kids watch the movie ``The Raven'', with the title ``The Raven'', as Homer and Milhouse sit
 reading the comic book.  ``We've never seen a comic book before.  So we thought it'd be fun to give you the
 best present yet.''  Homer reads the magazine, and Milhouse asks, ``What do you think?''  Homer
 answers, ``I'm going to be playing with it.  It's so hot out there!''  ``Aw, good idea, boys.''  Meanwhile, Maggie
 watches the TV report.  (``Awwwww!'')

       [The Simpsons are standing on the street looking at each other]
         [the audience laughs]
         [they look around and see "Homer Simpson"]
         [a sign reading "Free Parking" is displayed next to the parking lot]
             [Lisa walks past a sign saying "Free Parking", while Bart stands with his legs bent over]
            Oh, good thing there's free parking here, because you're paying us for it!  And we'll take advantage of your lousy
              parking spots.
            [everyone looks around, then sees "Homer Simpson"]
              Hey...you guys have parked right here!
           [Bart and Lisa walk out from behind the tree and hug]
          [Homer pulls up and runs off]
-- Homer's not so sure he likes it when a man gets shot at, 

The Simpsons arrive in the Springfield Retirement Castle.  Bart is still trying to figure out what his new plan is, but Marge reminds him that it's all just about getting
his butt back into shape.  He tells her she can't leave until he has some money to get rid of
it.  The kids laugh uproariously.

         [the family walks away, laughing]
         [Bart and Lisa look over at each other and chuckle]
Marge: I don't want to go home any more.
        [Everyone gasps and groans as they run outside; everyone else turns to stare]
-- Not good enough, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:24]

 The family sit down on the couch watching TV with Maggie.  It's the last time they've seen her since she left school.

Maggie: You're going to be really nice to me, Dad, even if it means leaving now.
Homer: Well, I think I should try something different tomorrow.
Maggie: Oh, OK.
Homer: [gulps] But you have to promise not to leave again.
Marge: Bart, this has been an extremely difficult day for us.
Homer: Mmm...I'm so sorry about everything.  We can't afford a house without money!
Maggie: Homer, we're going to take our children to school tomorrow, but what are we going to do?
Homer: What do we get?
Marge: We don't know.  Lisa said that there were no plans.
Homer: How much is $20 million?
Maggie: A little over $2 million!  And then you go out and make millions off us, and you lose your job, and you start taking care of your kids.
Homer: Yeah, fine, honey.  But where am I going to pay for it?
Marge: Mom, when did you realize it was worth doing this?
Homer: No.  Because we didn't want to leave.
Marge: I guess you'd say you could just stay here forever.
Homer: Maybe, maybe not forever.
Marge: I dunno, honey.  That sounds like a great idea.
Homer: I'll give them one more chance at freedom.
Marge: But first, I gotta tell you, I never had a dream before.  I
        dreamed I could be the best mother I could ever be.
Homer: [giggles] Well, what's the difference between a dream and a reality?
-- Homer, free agent, 

Marge is in bed with her husband.

 Homer: Mmm...I'm glad I can finally have my dreams.
-- Bart's dream of self-love, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 20:17]

The next day, Homer wakes up in bed.  He reads "Happy Little Elves" by Herman Melville in a book titled, ``My
dreams: A Dream Life'' and looks around anxiously as Lisa reads `Dying on a Dancer\' while he
reads.
    
   Homer: Mmm...I'm glad I can finally have my dreams.
           And let me assure you that every waking moment will be filled with a beautiful woman who will always
        love me unconditionally.
-- The final words of his dream, 

At breakfast, Marge tells Homer that she wants him to take off his dress.  She asks him to go out to get some exercise.
