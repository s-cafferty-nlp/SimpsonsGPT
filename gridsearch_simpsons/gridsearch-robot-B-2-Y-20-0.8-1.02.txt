EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 In the present, Maggie (the robot) tries to get some work done.  Homer
 asks Bart how he's doing.  ``He looks like a really nice human being.''
 Bart thinks it might be time to stop making his own money.  He walks into an empty
 bathroom and sees that everyone has been leaving.  The two of them laugh uproariously.

 At home, Bart reads a book about Lisa's job as an assistant.  When
 they walk through the door, they see Lisa in her room with a magazine
 in front of a big, red-rimmed photo of herself on the bed.  ``Wow!''  She turns
 away and begins reading again.

 EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 While at school, Bart and Lisa are preparing to play ``Bart Gets Rich Quick'' on their
 homework.  They sit down at a table and talk to Principal Skinner.  ``Hey, Dad!''  ``What do you think we should do?''
 Skinner gives Bart a list of things to do.  It includes buying Bart a new car, selling Bart toys,
 and getting him out of school.  But he doesn't want to let the kids drive off with him, so he offers to pay for
 the car himself.  ``I'll give you $50 million...or I can just take it out of your hands.''  So
 Bart accepts the offer, but he says, ``Yeah, what if I could put something else in it.''  Ned
 explains that it's not going to sell anything.  ``That would make sense,'' he adds.  "But it would also mean
 having to go over our budget."  Homer takes a break from school to read to himself, then
 gets back into his car and drives off again.

 The family drive through downtown Springfield.  Marge is driving by with her dog, and
 when she sees Lisa walking past, she runs for the door.  She calls, ``Marge!  What's going on?''  But
 they stop at an intersection and look around.  It looks like they've got plenty of parking spots, but
 the traffic is so heavy it makes it difficult to get up.  A sign tells them they're now allowed to park outside the
 city limits.  (``Park inside the city limits, kids.'')  They do, and Maggie gives them their keys.  In
 the parking lot, Moe greets everyone.  ``You know how many cars we have?'' he continues, ``The ones that don't come
 anywhere near the freeway.''  Everyone gasps, then turns and starts running down Main Street.  Meanwhile,
 there's a big crowd of people who want to buy tickets to see Barney play ``Dancing with the Stars'' on the red
 horn.  He pulls up in front of the arena, where Marge has set up a sign saying, ``Don't be alarmed: the only
 way to get tickets is to walk into the arena.''  He walks towards the
 arena, then stops and looks around.  At the bottom of the ramp, a bunch of kids are cheering, while the
 announcer announces, ``Bart's back!''
 Bart gets his ticket.

   Homer: [gulps] Oh, I thought it was cool.  That guy had an idea: he wanted to show us the best
   game of the year.
   -- ``''
   
 Back at home, Moe tells them to keep their heads down.  ``We'll need you guys for tonight.''  A big party begins.  They all start
 singing ``Dancing With The Stars'' from the Springfield Coliseum.  (``What's that?'' asks Homer.)  Lisa sings `Homer's Back'
 again, but this time she uses her hair as a substitute for the sax.  She makes some more noise by
 playing her bass and singing along with the players, and they sing along.  But when the crowd chants, "Ow!  Ow!"
 Maggie sings, ``The sound of music will awaken &lt;all&gt; hearts &gt;.''  So Bart dances off stage, dancing with the boys...
   
   Ned:  Well, if you're going to be able to take advantage of our special guest tonight, we've got to make sure he knows how
          to dance.
    -- Homer plays a minor-league ball, ``''
   
   It's Moe's birthday party!  The Springfield Symphony Orchestra plays a duet at the Springfield Civic Auditorium, and Lisa takes
       some pictures of her in front of a giant portrait of herself on a
            statue of the late Marge Simpson.
    ... Lisa has a picture of herself on a statue of Marge Simpson?
   
   I was just wondering if there were any other things she could use to get rid of this little plaque...
   -- Principal Skinner asks Mr. Burns to help build the new school, ``''
   
   [Homer turns the page]  Ahem.
   -- Marge writes to Homer, ``I'm sorry about all the noise you caused, but it's not my fault that
           nobody else is paying attention.  There's no way I can afford to spend
       money on a big, ugly piece of junk!''
          Oh, good God.  This thing's so old!  What'd it cost us to have it replaced by
          one of these crappy statues of me?
  ... when Lisa says she was going to write a letter to the Springfield Shopper, Mr. Burns tells her they'll need to make up their
      budget for an air show in Springfield?
         It's _really_ nice to know you've made something of yourself and I really don't want to hear anything about it
        now.
         Well, maybe we should check with our school president to see what he thinks.
          [Marge takes off Bart's mail, then drops it down the toilet]
         [Bart sighs]
           But this isn't even close to being a true "Homer Simpson" statue.
           If there are any signs that this guy's alive, they're at the bottom of a pile of garbage
         right here.
-- Not quite a sign, indeed, 

Lisa: You must be thinking too hard...to get out of bed.
