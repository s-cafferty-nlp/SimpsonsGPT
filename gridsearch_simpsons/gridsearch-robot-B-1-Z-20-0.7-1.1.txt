EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 At the Springfield Retirement Castle, Lisa sits on her bed. She looks up at Homer when he's come to talk
about what happened in his first year with that old pony! {tm}

 Bart tries again (and fails) for Maggie and Selma... but she doesn't get it right either. [End of Act Three]
 EPISTEME DESCRIPTION: While listening to this episode, I was inspired by two things about our lives from
the beginning: First, we were both children who had no interest in money; secondly,... well, you know _what_ happens after school?
-- Not all kids enjoy their jobs as much as they like them, "Who Shot Mr Burns!?  Part One"

{At home, everyone cheers loudly.}
Homer walks out into Moe's Tavern dressed in an orange shirt and tie behind Ned's desk while munching ice cream cones.
(``Wow!'', ``We should've taken him.''), then stops off back inside because there are more people around than before.
Everyone else takes turns singing along to music made entirely from foodstuffs -- such decadent concoctions
that some even say God gave us life-saving appendages instead of medicine.

 The scene switches focus momentarily over Freddy Quimby eating pizza outside Krusty's Pizza Hut which has become quite
large indeed thanks almost to its own artificial turf.... And now Barney gets stuck trying to escape through one of those rubber chairs set
up just beyond Flanders' entrance window where everybody seems to be having fun doing something silly or bizarre
funny too often without actually knowing how many other adults have done so since childhood.
The camera pulls close enough times to see various faces making noises indicating imminent danger if ever seen during any
time frame above 12F20+2G19P15C30W10H21M25

  Burns: Well, I've got a feeling that it's going to get worse before the end of this week!
Nelson-Lambert and Homer (both laughing) walk down Main Street in their green VWs as they watch television on TV... [laughs]
Burnstein is taken away by police officers after he tells them about his escape plan at Moe's Tavern which involves stealing from Barney when Ned buys him an old Cadillac for $500
and selling off Bart's house himself with stolen credit card money back into town treasury through phony checks paid out via "Cash Only" cards instead
of cash deposits made directly onto public land using only banknotes deposited manually electronically rather than paper bills?
-- The most pressing concern over ``Operation Twist'' comes courtesy of `Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds'!, 
(``I'm gonna go home tomorrow!'')}

 At Springfield Elementary School, Principal Skinner announces plans to sell all remaining classrooms until lunch time -- but Lisa refuses to take part because she fears losing her seat next
to another student who has been missing forever due _her_ teacher class even longer. {rlgjfw}: In fact, none of these students seem particularly interested in school work anyway.
Skinner suggests Marge spend some more quality material elsewhere while Krusty continues to preach abstinence education/anti-fat shaming policies outside
the classroom door like Santa Claus had once said ("Go easy on yourself!"), although everyone else appears concerned lest we hear anything new coming from him

  Bart: Dad! I don't think this class is going anywhere unless the whole world goes bonkers...and you're a monster who needs help
	in your own home life and not just my wife's (or son's) self-esteem
	so that he can have it all out with us at his bedside without hurting anyone or disrupting our otherwise healthy relationships
	with other kids around
-- Lisa realizes she may be missing something important -- but only after having gone through her entire high school history book for herself?
{tm} ``''
 The next day, Skinner shows off an old newspaper clipping titled ``The Principal Burns Story''. [7[FG]04]

 At lunch time, Homer tells Maggie what happened when Mrs. Krabappel was forced to pay $500K per student because they were too thin.
 He asks if there are any problems between them; Msgr. Hoover answers `no'. Meanwhile, Sideshow Bob plays catch up by talking about how little respect &ltgthe principal has over Mr Simpson
who uses money as collateral against others.}
Homer tries to explain why everything works so well except himself. A few days later, SLA announces their intentionÂ to sell its shares immediately following
their sale last week. It seems obvious enough yet difficult for many people to understand exactly where things stand now, despite the good intentions
that went into selling stock early yesterday morning @ 6am local Time.  But one thing remains constant throughout - even though no public forum exists until shortly thereafter
for discussion purposes.
