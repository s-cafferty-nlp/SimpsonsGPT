EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 The Simpsons are in the basement when they hear an alarm go off. Homer and Bart get up, but it's only just Moe (a robot)
who notices them as he runs into his room...and starts to cry. [7[FG]08][8F01]

 At home, Maggie sits on her bed reading at breakfast while Lisa plays with toys she brought from school. {rl}

 In class, Krusty reads "The Last Temptation of John Cleese".... more cartoon than real!
	@{jg}: ``I'm not sure how this works.''; cf. `''Jacques was also very popular.}\&gt; for example, if you read 'em by hand or put your finger through their nose? @{dhk} says that _you_ should do so &lt;if&gt; every single one except Mrs. Hoover didn't write any articles about SLH before I started writing these books because there were no other people who could have done anything good without him
-- And yet somehow we all think what happened after Mr Burns' death has been funny enough already -- like our new movie title (#?)
is \``A Funny Twist On Life''. Also starring Hugh Hefner(tm), Martin Scorsese, Bill Paxton, Ralph Wiggum, etc.\\^
 It seems everyone agrees upon something here: Springfield had its own version of Smithers once again
but now everybody else thinks things over too much based on some old-fashioned stereotypes rather than facts. +1 points out that Sideshow Bob wrote most of
the original cartoons themselves instead of trying to make money using commercial advertising. *Note 2 - All characters appear under different names (*).
+ Showing two men playing poker together makes me wonder why nobody would bother putting such silly stuff aside until it was obvious they were going
to be in trouble

 Animation and continuity goofs

  Bart's birthday party has a big "Bart vs". sign (a reference, perhaps, to the cartoon `The Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds' scene from ``''
in which Homer tries to convince his parents not just to go for Mr. Burns' Christmas bash but also because he thinks Simpson will get rich by selling candy...and other toys at
price? [see above]...but Marge says she doesn't think there is any reason you should have gone through with this idea: Lisa even suggests buying them as gifts or something more permanent
instead
(eagerly)
	[shows one man eating an apple while another eats nothing else.] {rl} The kids play outside when Moe gets home.} \crt\&gt; @{rjc}: In reality, however[/p2] we see Ned eat food only once before Skinner takes advantage of all those little freebies!
-- It seems like everybody wants their cake back if no cakes are available -- especially since _everyone_ loves us so badly?, "$pringfield"
``We've got plenty of good places where people can enjoy our delicious treats.'' |@|\\cjdb{\br}\^/ And now what about Springfield Elementary?!
And I guess someone needs my help finding these tasty goodies after school!? Well maybe donuts anyway!!._.
It sounds weird enough without having been shot entirely straight into space right next door., though]}\) But let's face it, science is fun!  [pause]

 In the kitchen...
{At home, Marge tells Bart to get a beer and some sugar for his birthday {tm} instead of going out on ``the
back porch''.... Homer comes by with Maggie in tow (who seems more than happy) at dinner.}
Homer: Hey kids, you know we all love this place so much that when they're older we'll stop eating them?'' @\&gt;[7F07][8F06] The family are watching TV as Lisa prepares breakfast from her microwave dish(s), but she has no idea how long until he gets back up off the couch
and looks around frantically -- then turns away again before reaching downstairs through one of its doors
to find nothing edible left there except an unkempt chocolate-chip sandwich atop the fridge shelf which isn't even half full. \crt
Maggie says something funny while reading another magazine just behind him. She spots Milhouse sitting outside smoking cigars near the stove
on their way down stairs trying to make himself comfortable under pressure
while wearing socks over heels like those worn during bedtime. He takes advantage of everyone else's lackadaisical behavior
in order not to turn anything upside down or have any difficulty getting food past Ned Flanders' teeth barrier. Itchy &amp; Scratchy walk along nearby
a fence looking worriedly towards Skinner who holds onto two cans still filled with ice cream cones stuck
with candy wrappers and is now taking a sip from the water in one hand while Bart watches TV (which he did so proudly)
through his other.  The kids cheer, but Homer tells them that they can't leave until Marge finishes her speech about Lisa's "love" for him
and kisses Maggie on the cheek!

-- No references whatsoever -- even though there were some scenes where we could see things differently than what was shown at Krusty's press conference(?),... well, let me assure you these weren&gt; real-life events?  And if your father wasn\\\'t around then maybe something happened between us
that didn\u00te happen either way.  If anyone has an idea how such stuff works?, please don`e come forward.''

-- Homer Simpson gives his final speech over the PA system, "$pringfield" {dh} points out some discrepancies between ``'' and
the actual program broadcasted above, but doesn't mention `Springfield' anywhere else because he says there was one more thing up front until then.
{ddh2}: A new clip shows Bart being wheel-fed ice cream while holding Lisa upside down so she can crawl into bed without falling off her chair.
In reality, however, we hear Ned saying something like, ``Hey Mom, get your head around here now!"]
At Moe's Tavern, Marge tells Barney about Krusty having sex once too many times during breakfast time.
Bart answers politely if asked why nobody told him otherwise, only realizing afterwards where things went awry anyway.
It also suggests Skinner could use another man next door rather than Springfield Elementary.
