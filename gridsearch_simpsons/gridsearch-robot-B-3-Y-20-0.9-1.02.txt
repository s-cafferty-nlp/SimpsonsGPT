EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Lisa arrives home with her sister, Bart and Selma.  She spots them on the porch and
walks into the living room, where Homer looks at her.

Lisa: [gasp] Mom...what are you doing?
Homer: I'm just playing around with my kids' toys.  They're all adorable.
 Lisa: [groans] Dad, what are you doing?
Homer: Well, we had to do something about the dogs in our garage because they weren't
      loving enough of us.  We _had_ to have them get a
       nice dog, so that was kind of hard on everyone.
-- No wonder he's always been such a jerk,

   You know, when people think about `the bad guys', it usually means one thing: one bad guy.
   -- Homer makes his final decision, ``''
   
   Bart: Are you sure this is the best idea you've ever heard?
   Ms.K: Yes, but there are many things wrong with Mr. Simpson.
   Principal Skinner: He needs an extra pair of pants.
   Bart: {I can't believe your father didn't even go through with it!}
   Superintendent Skinner: {You want to see what you got, sir?  That's just a cheap
   novelty piece.}
   Mrs.K: {You're right, I _love_ you.  But...what do you think you should be doing?
           [a man in a blue dress walks up]
   Bart: {Hey, boy, why don't we give him another chance?  It'll cost $50,000!  Now let's get rid of that old lady from
          Springfield!
   -- Homer talks to Lisa about his plans for her wedding, ``''
   
  Homer: You know, if something doesn't work out, it could end up being good, and I'd really love you to
          spend a few more seconds talking to somebody who understands my point.
         Well, maybe not yet, but at least they have some respect for us.
           [Homer goes on to explain that he never intended to marry Maggie; she gets a raise of her own
         when he's older.]
-- No romance at first sight, 

Marge tries to convince Homer to make a big deal of his predicament.

 Lisa: Dad, what about Bart?
Homer: I don't want to be the one with him!  He's an awful person and I've always had this problem with him...
Lisa: And it _is_ true.  It's funny because --
Homer: [sotto voce] I can understand you if you're thinking about it, but we've got to find out where he's going.
Marge: Oh, I guess I'm getting closer to finding out what makes Mr. Burns so upset.  But it will probably just take
        me five minutes and then I'll learn something
        important.  We have to find out why Mr. Burns is angry and how much time
        he really spends in our town.
Homer: You know, I'd like to think that would help.
Lisa: Then why don't you come down to your room and sit around and listen to your mother talk to you about
         things?
Homer: Because I do want you to stop being mad at me.  Now let's get out of here and start talking about
          our differences.  What makes us different?
-- A new idea, "King-Size Homer"

The family walk away from the house, but Lisa isn't interested in the conversation any more.

 Lisa: Dad!  [to herself] All right, we have a problem, Bart!  We've got an issue.  There is nothing wrong with
           people loving each other unconditionally.
Homer: It's true -- if we weren't so cruel and selfish, then there wouldn't be any
         problems.  If you didn't take advantage of those feelings, they wouldn't exist.
Marge: Well, maybe it was just that we didn't realize what _that_ meant until after dinner.
Homer: Mmm...no, it's not _really_ a problem because we're all good parents.
-- Not every parent wants to spend time with his son, 

At home, Homer opens a book on Homer's daydreams.  The only thing missing is the words for ``Homer''.

Homer: Oh, Mom, I guess I'm finally going to find a way to put my own name back into this world.
         [opens the book]
-- Homer's dream come true, 

 Lisa: Dad, you'll have a great father when he gets out of here.
Marge: But first -- and last!  Let us make room for the rest of the family in this little house!
Homer: What!?
Lisa: Dad, just give up!  We've got to get him some money and start making ends meet.
-- A new normal, 

In the kitchen, Homer suggests they try another one of their favorite things: the Simpson dinner.
Homer: No!  It's just like our old house.
-- Ned tells Ned that if he tries anything crazy, they might as well go bowling, 

The family enjoy their breakfast.

Homer: You know, Bart, there's nothing so perfect about eating at your own restaurant.
 Bart: Yeah, but don't blame yourself, man.  If you ever see any of us eat at home, please call &lt;me&gt;
Homer: That's what makes me want to stay at home.  Just keep telling me it was _my_ place.
-- "The End of an Era," 

Homer drives off.  Next up is Smithers' birthday party.
