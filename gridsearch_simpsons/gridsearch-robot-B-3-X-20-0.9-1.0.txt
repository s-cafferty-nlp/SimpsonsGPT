EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Marge is in a bar, drinking a beer when she hears a loud noise.  She looks around to see Bart

walking towards her.  "Oh, that's Lisa!  She's gone," she exclaims, turning around.  Bart is in
his room.  "Hey, Bart!  What's up?  Oh, that's Marge!"  She
sighs, "She said she had a dream, Dad," and laughs.  "Oh, I thought I was
going to say the first words, but...what's the first thing I said?"  Homer asks
Marge, "Oh, what's the first thing I said?"  Bart answers, "You have to be careful, Homer."  Homer asks Marge to
get dressed.  She does, and she spots a sign that reads "The Bart Simpson Show".  Marge
hastily puts her shirt back on, and she says, "Hello, Dad!  How's everything?"  Bart is
stunned, "Oh, it's good to see you," and Lisa says, "Hi, Dad!"  Homer
runs towards the door, but he's too late.  "Oh, I'm sorry I called the cops," he cries.  "That's me," he
says, "it's Maggie," and Marge looks up, and she spots the sign again.  "Hey, Marge," she
sighs, "Marge!  What's the first thing I said?"  Homer asks, "What's the first thing I said?"  Marge
sighs, "Oh, it's Bart Simpson!"  Marge looks up again, and she says, "Hi, Dad!"

Marge's still wearing her shirt, and Homer is worried about his father's appearance.  "Hey, what's
what?" asks Marge, "I don't want to get any closer to him.  I'm
really worried about him," says Bart, and Marge sighs, and Homer says, "What's the first thing
I said?"

At home, Homer's been thinking about Homer for weeks, but he has trouble sleeping, and Marge's not sure why.

Homer: Marge, I want you to think about this.  [laughs] You're in trouble.  I know what's going on, but I can't get
anything else done!  I'm going to need that money, and I want to be the man that
says what I say.  I want to do something I can't do.  You gotta be the man that says what you say!
Marge: Dad, I think you're going to think about it.
Homer: [laughs] I'm not going to believe it.  I'm going to be the man that says what I say.
Marge: [laughs] Well, I do want you to think about that, but I can't.
Homer: I can't do it.  I'm going to be the man that says what I say.
-- The last straw, 

Homer is aghast.  He tells Marge to let Homer go, and Marge agrees, but she suggests they meet him at a movie.  Homer
sits on his bed, his legs spread out and his eyes dart towards the screen.

Homer: Hey, Marge, what's wrong?  I thought we should go see the movie.
Marge: Dad, if I were you, I'd be proud.  We could have been friends forever.
Homer: Dad, I think we should see that movie.
Homer: It was a terrible movie, but I didn't want to go out on the streets, so I just bought a ticket.
Marge: [scoffs] Yeah, but I was just saying I was going to watch the movie for the first time.
Homer: And I didn't want to go out on the streets, but we can't have a movie in this house.
-- Homer the fool, 

Homer and Marge look at each other.  Homer tells Marge it was funny, but Marge says he was trying to help him
find a movie he could actually enjoy.

Homer: [waking up in the car] What the heck, what the heck?  We've been in that car since we
        got out of college.  But this movie has been
            for like three weeks, and we've had no success.
-- Homer the fool, 

Homer and Marge run into each other again.

Homer: Homer, you're not going to win the lottery tonight, are you?
Marge: No, I want to go out on the streets and play with our friends.  So I can get to know
          everyone better.
Homer: What?
Marge: You've always been such a great friend, Marge.
Homer: Oh, that's true.  I've always been a great friend, Marge.
Homer: Oh, well, I'm going to go out on the streets and play with our friends.  I'm going to play with
          all my friends.
-- Homer's only hope of winning the lottery, 

Homer's friends try to get him a ticket, but the ticket says, "No entry."

Homer: Hey, don't panic, you little faunus.  I don't want you to get a ticket and you'll never get a ticket.
-- Homer's only hope of winning the lottery, 

Marge comes home from work and opens the door for Homer.  Homer opens the door and finds Lisa
sitting on the bed, her legs still shaking.  She hugs Homer, but Homer
says, "Come on, let's get out of here.  I'm going to have some fun."  Marge
sighs.

Homer: Marge, don't panic.  I don't want to get the tickets and you'll never get a ticket."  Marge
sighs again.

Marge: Homer, you don't want to get tickets!  You just want to get outta here.
Homer: I'll tell you the truth.  I think you'll be a good man someday.  I'll have a baby, a
        baby, and a job.
Marge: I've thought about it.  I'll make the decision for you, Marge.
Homer: All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right...
