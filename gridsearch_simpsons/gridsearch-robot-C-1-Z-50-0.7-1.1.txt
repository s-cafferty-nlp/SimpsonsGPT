EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 At the Simpsons home, Homer asks Bart to explain his decision.... more
 than one of them has shown up in their underwear at Moe's Tavern...a picture!'' [7[FG]24]
	{} The photo appears on Mr. Burns' card-board as part _of_ ``Burns Card Collection''. {8[FG]11]
	Homer wishes he was wearing shorts instead of briefs and &lt;his&gt; pants.}
 Rosenfield observes that Simpson had been using an old sewing machine for years (though not always)
	before this episode aired because it would have made him look younger while driving away from work.
 Advertisement
	(tm) A simple advertisement introduces "Bart Gets Smiled By His Employer", but no longer shows any sign of being taken off duty by Ned Flanders or even Abe Lincoln himself
	and/or Lisa.'' \c\rd While there are two major problems with such ad campaign material, I believe they were all done deliberately so we don't see anything unusual about Springfield until after Itchy gets hit by lightning
	with its own megaphone @ 1F01]} Carl explains how much fun people can make when working out naked without having shoes attached
	on either foot--which seems odd since most workers wear shoe covers over ankles which allow scantily clad feet above ground
	to walk freely through town streets outside
	while walking around like normal men dressed exactly alike before entering the workplace.
	The advertising indicates several other locations where employees may be seen doing nude acts during public holidays including Little Italy
	where children play under treehouses atop cardboard boxes containing various things called `Eggplant'.
	A billboard reading 'Nude+Simpson', only now showing some sort?@1C3G2I9V4W5QH8F7K

 BG: [pause]  Is this a good idea, or is it just another excuse to make fun of us all for being naked in front and...[coughs more coughs]} @{dh} - Dr. Hibbert's voice over when Bart says he wants Homer out!
-- Marge explains that her husband isn't wearing underwear yet (though she did try once), "?"

\(
&gt; Lisa has an easy time accepting such absurdly outrageous suggestions as ``you're not making any money'' from them even though they've been scientifically proven
to work wonders on humans &lt;all_ your body fat limit by weight loss surgery combined. {ddh}
It seems we have finally reached our goal here.}\)
That evening at dinner with Ms. Krabappel, I think there was something very important going on -- but which one _wasnudged_ me right off my butt?!#!!
What do you mean, no nudes!?|Why don\'t people wear clothes so silly?, etc.?||{\quad}
And what if someone asks how many times can somebody get their hands dirty without actually removing themselves completely??^0
We see Maggie sitting next door looking disgusted inside herself while Ned takes turns licking his lips instead of sucking him away.
Maggie tries using lipstick again until Mr S makes up noises about having sex outside himself because nobody else would notice anything wrong
with eating food anyway. She then proceeds to kiss everyone on the cheek, but Bart is more interested in her than she was when he gave it a go at first
and only reluctantly took part
in helping out with cleanup and maintenance for ``''

 At home...  Homer: [on TV] Hey! I didn't hear you say that one time before we got into this -- er, _the_ "I did not know" thing happened?... yeah, uh, well let's just get started here now.''

EPVIII]

 After breakfast...``D'oh!'', Marge asks why there hasn&lt;never been any talk between Mrs. Burns and Milhouse &lt;about-herself since they met during their date night dinner together last week.
Homer explains what had transpired over lunchtime as `an act of rebellion against my father'. \|And who am i kidding?, eh?!
The family take seats around Moe's Tavern where Barney sits quietly reading some books through an armful of cards from Miss Hoover's collection.
He notices Ms.Bart holding something under another table which reads 'Miss Hoover Simpson Memorial Day card.'  But no word has come down yet so far.
Mr. Largo shows off pictures taken behind closed doors showing them clearly displaying children playing tennis or dancing outdoors in
their rooms, and Mrs Bart says that it would be nice to get out a little while early for her first-borns
to learn about the world outside our walls.

 Lisa: What are you doing? [gets up] I've got nothing better than this!...I mean...it could turn into my career as
	[hands over his diploma]}{Lisa}: It seems like there have been many wonderful things happening inside your home lately.
Mrs. K: {Oh yeah.} Well we can't just sit around all day talking nonsense when they're not even bothering us with homework because
	they know exactly what kind &lt;we&gtouve learned today.
 Homer: So _you_ don\'t want any more parents getting married?!'' (looks at photo) Oh boy!
-- The big picture is becoming less important now, 

Homer takes Marge aside again by giving him free tickets on school bus rides back to class. She explains she was trying hard to put herself ahead of everyone else who had money
and lost their jobs during World War II. After seeing how much fun Milhouse plays video games he thinks maybe someday someone will take advantage thereof
of everybody having trouble keeping track of everything except themselves. At lunchtime every morning Mr Higgum tries
``Aah! Get yourself one quick bite of pizza.'' Maggie eagerly agrees but realizes once Apu gets bored enough too quickly people won'',
she'll go crazy next time instead of making excuses until dinner arrives. -- Ned eats breakfast before bed}

  Homer: {[sighing] I hope the kids can enjoy this...and eat it right now, Bart.}
-- Marge is a bit concerned about her father's health, "King-Size Homer" in ``''
\(
Maggie and Selma walk past various garbage cans on an empty street with their mouths closed as they drive through town where everyone has been eating for days (with no ill effects)
as far as we know. It was just Lisa who came home from school to find that she had gotten eaten by all three adults at Freddy Quimby when he shot himself while trying to stop them
from attacking his wife; Barney also comes out after seeing what happened during Moe's Law School class. [8[FG]24]
The scene cuts back again later down Main Street towards Springfield Elementary along Highway 401 near Skinner Towne Park which appears deserted shortly thereafter
on its side only inches away. The two cops try to get some more attention elsewhere though despite being surrounded by police cars driving up
the hill above nearby parkland without permission or even noticing any danger ahead. Meanwhile Mayor Kerny goes over there anyway because nobody cares much if anything falls apart either way
until Burns calls him `Mayor'....
