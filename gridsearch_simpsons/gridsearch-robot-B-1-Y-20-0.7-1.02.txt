EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer goes to the Simpsons' house.  Bart has been sleeping on the couch, and
Bart's mother calls him a robot.  Lisa suggests he go out for some coffee with her.  Homer says
she's not going to be so nice to him.  ``I'm not going to eat any more!''  So she tells him to get back in his room
and listen to the music.  She plays ``The Happy Little Elves'' by
Ned.

 In the kitchen, everyone gets their lunch, but nobody wants to leave.  A woman asks what they're eating, and everyone
says, ``We don't want to see you eating anything.''  The man who comes into the kitchen
calls at Ned, ``Oh, great...we've got another problem.''  He puts them all in his car and drives off.  It
does so, only to find that it has an old TV set lying around.  "Wow!" exclaims Ned, ``It's really good!''  Homer
walks outside to see where everything is.  He sees Ned driving past the house.  But he stops and looks up from the
TV, then realizes that there is no TV set there.  He looks down again and sees
a TV set sitting in front of a refrigerator.  (``Oh, oh, I can't believe we just bought one of those,'' he sighs.)
Homer tries to sleep on the couch, but it's too hot.  Marge explains that he should watch `The Happy Little Elves'
in bed, but Homer doesn't have enough energy to do so.  Meanwhile, Homer is enjoying himself on the couch.
 [End of Act Three.]
    
   Moe: [quietly] Oh, Dad, your father always said I could get away with being
         a bad influence on you.
         You've got to be kidding me.  I don't think I ever thought about that before.
       Heh heh.
          Now, what about if you want to stay?  If you're going to stay, let's see, and maybe this is the best way to go
               out of here.
Marge: Well, uh, there's nothing wrong with staying.  It's just...it's not like _that_ kind of money makes any difference.
           But when they start making money, they'll say, ``We'll make it back!''
-- The best thing could come of our meddling parents, 

At home, Bart takes a nap.  Marge reminds him that his dad still watches `The Happy Little Elves'
on the TV.  And she tells him he has to keep an eye on Maggie.  At home, Marge says, ``And then
when you get sick, &lt;I'm&gt; going to die...''

 Lisa sits at her computer reading a book.  She's in bed reading the `Bart's
 Weekly Digest'.  Homer gets up and starts writing, but Lisa is too distracted by the
crying.  Meanwhile, Bart is playing with the phone.  (``You can't turn on the light on this stupid
thing.'')  But when he comes downstairs, he sees Lisa sitting at the table, eating
her lunch.  ``Hey, Dad, I've got some good news: we're getting married!''
   
   Homer: [reading]  It's time for us to have a family.  We've got to give away the key!
   -- Bart's weekly digest, ``''
   
   Moe: Oh, Mom, what are you doing?  You know, we'd rather be spending your money than wasting it.
   Bart: Well, let me just say, if there's anything we haven't learned about the
        future, we should listen to it.
   Homer: No, Mom, I said don't eat yourself.  If you ever think you've done anything wrong, you might want to
        read something else.
          [they read "Gossip Channel", `Clerk', and `Homer's Choice' in alphabetical order]
Marge: Mm hmm.  What do you mean, I'm going to read a book by someone who knows how to write?
-- A bit of advice for her new friends, 

Lisa reads the magazine.

 Lisa: The best thing that could have happened to us was we got our first job as writers.
Homer: Oh, yeah?  And...
 Lisa: We're not going to get our first job because they'll never forgive us.
Homer: But we _did_ learn something important!
 Lisa: All right, but what about when he asks why we can't go back to work?
Homer: Because he's not an old man.
 Lisa: Uh, okay.  Now this is bad news for him.
        [everyone applauds]
 Lisa: So now we need a babysitter.
Homer: Yeah, good idea.
 Lisa: Let's see, Lis.  It's a simple question: why aren't we having any kids?
        [Homer puts on a tuxedo]
          [everyone laughs, except Krusty]
Krusty: Look at that --
Lisa: I'm going to be the new babysitter.
Homer: What!?
-- Marge and her baby talk about their future, 

Marge: Homer, you're so smart!  You don't have to be a genius to get what you want.
Homer: And if it sounds like I'll take a job in the next five years, then I will.
-- No more pretentiousness, 

The family drives off down Interstate 75 to Springfield Elementary School.

 Bart: Dad, Mom, how come no one has been home yet?  We've got nothing but fun here.
Homer: Oh, yeah.
 Bart: But I _can't_ live without your help.  If you don't give me money, my life will be ruined.
-- The best thing ever, 

Bart gets out of bed and goes up to the bathroom, where Bart tells everyone to watch TV.  Everyone looks around anxiously.  ``Hey, look, everybody!  How come all these kids are watching TV?''
Everyone gasps as they hear Homer scream incoherently.
