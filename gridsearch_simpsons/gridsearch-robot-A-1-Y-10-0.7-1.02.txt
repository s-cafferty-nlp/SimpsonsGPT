EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 The Simpsons are on the road.  Lisa and Maggie watch TV, but it's only for
special programming.  Homer tries to explain to them that he has no idea what's going on in
the world.  ``We've got a lot of money and we don't have a home.  We need something more
powerful than this.''  Bart asks, ``What's _your_ house?''  Homer tells him they can buy
a new one if they sell everything they own!  Meanwhile, at the Simpson home,
Lisa sits with her parents outside the front door.  They're upset about
her being late for school, but she insists they just go out for the night.  She
happily accepts.

 At Moe's Tavern, Marge makes an announcement...
``Hey, I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay tonight.''  He hands Homer his card.  "You get three drinks at Moe's Tavern, and one at
the bar!"  Everyone cheers.  Homer opens the fridge, and sees Marge drinking beer.
 ``I'm not drunk yet!  I think I might as well take some rest from this.''  But before he can finish,
he falls off the edge of the table, and hits the glass.  It explodes into a pool of blood.  ``Oh,
my God, it's like a comet hitting a brick wall!''  The scene fades to a
flashback to Marge's room, where everyone is watching television.  A man in a pink shirt stands next to
him.  ``Hi, Dad!  You want to see our kids play?"  Marge answers, ``Yeah.''  He looks around frantically
and realizes he's gone.  ``Well, maybe I should try something else.''  He heads back inside.  "Hey, Bart!  [chuckles]
I think we've got some fun here," he says, but Homer doesn't seem impressed.
 ``We're going to have to get rid of the big guy.''  Lisa suggests they go to the
factory and make the money for the plant.

 At home, Bart watches TV with Milhouse.  ``What's the best way to get him out of here?''  Homer asks
to watch ``The Last Temptation of Homer Simpson''.  Bart explains that his father was a bad influence on
his son, and he wanted to be part of a successful family.  But as soon as
he started getting into trouble, he quit.  So Bart decides to take his advice from his dad.  As
a
walks up to him, he notices a sign: ``Flanders' Home-made Fun.''  It reads, ``If you don't pay attention,
you'll end up being trapped in your own house.''  Bart tries to talk him out of it, but he can't.
 ``My life has become so much easier than yours,'' he admits.  ``That's why I always said I would never leave
this place.''  When the doorbell rings, Bart walks down the hall.  ``Hello, Moe.''
 He finds Milhouse there, wearing a red dress.  ``Moe, I'm sorry I got you into this.  But...I just didn't get what
you were talking about!''  The two hug and kiss.

 Homer sits at home watching TV on the couch, trying to find some sort of diversion.  Marge is upset that his
 mother
 was able to make him work for her company without taking advantage of the
 promotion.  She asks Lisa if she could take care of the kids, and Homer suggests they go to
 school together.  ``You know how I feel?''  ``No way!''  At home, Homer tells Marge that
 he wants to be part of something special, but Lisa says, ``Don't worry, Dad.  We've got a new plan.''  As
 Bart watches TV, Bart imagines himself as a little boy, playing with dolls and toys.  (``Oh, yeah!'')  Maggie
 looks over at him and laughs, then reconsiders, ``Hey, Mom, we have a good idea where
we should go.''  Homer heads downstairs to pick up the news.  Meanwhile, at the
 Springfield Retirement Home, Bart is having a hard time finding any job.
 While Homer talks to the men who are working for the company, Bart sees an advertisement for
 "Bart Simpson's Family Therapy" on the front page.  ``What's going on here,
what's this?''  Lisa asks him, ``I'm not sure what I'm doing!''  (Homer has
 no idea.)  He goes upstairs to see the ad, and finds that it's about
 a man who wants to be a psychiatrist.  ``Oh, my God!''

 The family visit the home of Dr. Marvin Monroe.  They find a picture of Bart in the mirror,
 which they take to the living room.  At work, Bart reads a book titled ``The Art of Self-Help''
 with `The Raven' written on it.  ``This guy can't read anything...''  Homer takes his hand to the
 paper and writes `The Raven' on it.  Next, Bart tries to put himself through class.  A photo of Bart
 appears on the front page of the Springfield Post-Gazette.  Marge says she thinks he's just taking her word for it,
 but Bart doesn't believe her.  ``Well, maybe you're right, but don't _you_ think I'm right?''  Bart continues to
 write `The Raven' into the front page, writing `Marge Simpson's Guide to Successful &lt;Mindful Living.'  She closes
 her eyes and sighs as Bart reads the letter.  But after reading it again, she realizes she's
 too busy with her daydreaming to concentrate on the important stuff.  In fact, she imagines herself
 in bed, eating a sandwich while watching TV.

 At home, Homer sits at the kitchen table.  He is still upset that Lisa has gotten married, but he
 tells him she loves him.  ``You know, Dad, when I was going through my depression, I always thought we were having
 a baby, and I'd never be able to afford one!''  The family sit down.  Homer
 asks Marge if there are any good reasons for Maggie to marry Bart, and Marge responds, ``Maybe you should get rid of her.''  Meanwhile,
 the family watch TV.  Marge thinks they might have a better idea than to make fun of the
 marriage, but Homer refuses to listen to his mother.  As he talks to Bart, Marge
 notes that he doesn't like the way Lisa treats Maggie.  ``I just can't let them go out of their way to hurt us.  They'll kill us all
 forever.''  While Marge watches television, Homer says, ``If only there weren't some other guy in this house who could
 do something about that.''  Marge concludes, ``That's enough for me.''

 the door, Bart sees an old advertisement for a pink bunny.
