{At home, Homer watches the news.  The headline reads, "Lisa's Missing."  She has
gone to the bathroom to brush her teeth and she looks at it suspiciously.}

Homer: {So what?  I was going to pick her up...}
-- That was the first sign, 

The family walk down the street together.

Bart: {That was the first sign!  Ohh, they stopped walking.  They're just so much better.}
-- Bart's bad sign, 

"Look," says Ned, pointing to his forehead, "it'll be a long day ahead.  Tonight, we're going to have a big ol' test!"

Everyone laughs when he realizes he's lying on his bed, then falls asleep.

 Lisa arrives home from school, dressed in her favorite pink dress.
She explains that she wants a free sample of the bath salts she gave Homer.  Then starts to eat her lunch.
Her father tells her how sorry he is about all the fussing over the house.
He opens the door and finds Ned playing with his hand-held toy car while Lisa runs
through the kitchen window.  His arm rests on Maggie's shoulder and he imagines making out
the words, "I love you, Dad."  He hugs her and kisses her.
(Note the double-circles around Homer's face.)

Ned: {What did I do?  [reads it] Come home for dinner.  You could kill me!}
-- Homer's punishment, 

They sit in front of an empty table.  Everyone cheers and chides as Bart goes upstairs.

Homer: Oh, we can't blame him...'' observes Marge.  ``We're not going to get into a fight.''
Everyone else walks up to them with smiles.  Moe and Selma look down at each other with
glee.  Meanwhile, Homer sings `Sweet Seymour Skinner', which is played by ``The Beatles''.
 (Moe has never heard anything like that before.)

 In the car, Ned talks to Bart about his new project.  Lisa suggests they don't go
away until he shows Maggie something funny, but Ned admits that they've been having fun.  They _do_
work out together, and Homer takes over the garage door.  On the way home, Homer gets a phone call from Mr. Burns,
who tells him he has no money.  Bart sighs with relief.  ``Oh, great,'' he says, ``that was perfect!  I'll just have to take
your house to the casino.''  Bart gives Ned his best attempt yet, then heads off.  Later, he drives past
the casino and greets everyone.

 Back at home, Nelson sits at his breakfast.
 ``That's good news: our family is getting healthy again.  It's finally here!''  When Ned asks
 how much weight gain he will be using, Nelson says that it's $4,000 a year.  A man in
chocolate
 pudding goes through Bart's head.  Homer sighs heavily.  ``Gotta make up some _fugu_ for me.''
 The kids chuckle quietly as Bart eats some more pancakes, while Nelson and Barney giggle
ly.  At work, Otto takes Marge to the prom.  "We can do anything we want," he intones.  Everyone
 cheers, including Bart, who looks at him with wide-eyed incomprehension.  Then begins to say, ``Oh, come on, marge, please.''
 Meanwhile, Selma reads the Miss Hoover newspaper (and sees something funny there).
 She tells her daughter she loves Bart, but Lisa suggests they go to church next week.  But they
 are unable to attend because they're busy playing roulette.  Principal Skinner assures them
 they'll get their tickets after this Sunday.  As Bart opens the front door, he notices an advertisement for
 a bowling alley.  ``Now, little girls!  We don't need a bar!  It's time for our second anniversary party!''  Maggie
 offers to play her birthday card with Patty, and Selma insists that Bart win a free ticket.
 He walks out of the bar, into the Springfield Elementary School Cafeteria, and gets an autographed photo of himself.
 He runs over to see the crowd cheer, and catches himself.  ``Hey, Mr. President!  Oh my God, this is
 great!''

 At home, Skinner continues the tradition of opening new bottles of champagne.  ``I'm sure he'll give us
 another lucky number to turn on his old one.''  Homer rushes downstairs to pick up Bart.  ``What are you
 going to do, boy?  Make it stop tomorrow and get something for Dad and Mom?''  The waiter
 announces, ``You're done.''  Marge leaves, and Homer sits in the living room admiring the wine.
 She suggests that they continue the tradition of putting the champagne bottle back in the car when their
 date comes.
 (``Let's just say she isn't happy about _it_,'' says Miss Hoover.)  Principal Skinner invites Lisa to watch Barney's wedding video.
 She doesn't believe him, but goes upstairs to watch them again.  When Skinner steps outside to find Moe
 seated at the table with the rest of the kids, Marge reaches down to pick up his drink.  ``Oh, I've never seen that man go so well
 without some kind of sugar.''  They sip slowly as Homer closes his eyes.  ``Bart, look...there's nothing here!  Please, no sugar!''  But
 Bart scolds her: `There's a way!  Sugar won't make me any happier.'  Bart hands the beer to Homer, but
 has to restrain himself from eating it.  Meanwhile, Barney and Milhouse watch him enjoy the
 beer while Marge sits in the front row drinking its contents.  He walks out laughing
 through an open window and hops into the back seat of his car.

 The next morning, Marge wakes up at 7am to find Maggie waiting for her turn-over at school.
 ``That was a dream come true.  You made our little boy happy again.''  She suggests they check with the Principal.
 Marge arrives home and finds Bart still asleep.  ``Dad, don't take this too far.''  Lisa asks where he is going.
 ``Oh, goodie, you're always smiling when we see you around,'' she says, putting on a smile.  ``Oh, nice clothes, huh?
 Now, if there's anything that'll help you stay awake, please don't jump to conclusions.  It's not science.  It's just what happens
 somewhere.''  Skinner gives his son a hug.  ``And now, thank you, Mr. P. Simpson, for your time.''  Bart takes
 his turn into the middle of the class.  At work, Bart opens his mouth and looks around frantically.  "All right," he
 says, as he turns onto his vent, "we're going to be getting the entire house full of
 sugar.  Let's get started.
