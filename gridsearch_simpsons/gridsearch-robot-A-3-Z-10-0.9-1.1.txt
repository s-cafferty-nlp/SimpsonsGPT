EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 The Simpsons' house. {jd} [7[FG]06]

 Homer's birthday party at the Flanders Family Fun Centre, and he has no idea what it was like until one of his friends comes in to see him...
 (``Hey!'')... when Bart arrives home from school with Maggie dressed as her doll-girl costume
 she asks if there are any toys left that aren't covered by our `family'. ``Oh yeah?.''

 In bed Lisa says "Mommy..." while Milhouse reads through an old newspaper on how they've been playing for ages now without realizing who we really were
 despite all this new information about us being adults ourselves.
 At lunchtime Mrs. Simpson sits beside herself reading some books but notices something very odd over everyone else; nobody looks around except Mr _S_
Bart_. She quickly turns off both light switches so everything can be set up properly again.} @{bjr}

 A couple more times throughout Springfield music goes horribly awry -- including Moe singing 'The Happy Little Elves', whose theme plays during every tune sung
 after each note begins its own tempo before fading into incoherently rhythmic bursts upon impact.
 This causes many voices to turn out their backs towards them repeatedly or go back where none existed last time.

 Itchy &amp; Scratchy cartoon characters run amok across town along Route 401 heading south onto Mt. Splashmore just past
 Wrigleyville Road leading down Highway 7A2 straight ahead. (*cough*) Meanwhile Ned sings Hey Ya!, which sounds exactly alike only slightly altered since I don\'t know why people keep saying Hiya&gtzzz even though
 everybody knows nothing funny happened between here and these two places yet. +1@{dh}: \^oI'm sure someone could have gotten hurt because somebody thought my name was _so_ weird, but it's the one that makes me think
   of a movie or something!

 The scene in question shows an old man walking along his porch with Bart reading from a book while Lisa reads her favorite newspaper headline: ``The Great Grapes of Wrath''. [7[FG]04]
 {rjc} points out this isn't really about Homer at all...except for when he mentions some strange new idea to himself (``If you can get ridof your ugly face then let's see how much more attractive our world looks.'')
 He also suggests using "Bart Simpson" as a reference on television instead of `Lisa', who responds by asking if there is any good reason she should stay home during Christmas time.}\eQ
 It turns into another bizarre story where Marge has been forced to play hostess/singer after seeing Mr. Burns singing Miss Springfield Homecoming song again once every five minutes @ 8pm?\\|(8pms!)
 At school, everyone seems happy enough not to go outside so they sing their own songs until Mrs Stacy asks them what else will be happening next day &lt;everyoneelse says no thanks anyway!!''...or like we would say everything goes well except maybe Bob
 tells Maggie things are bad now too. So Skinner takes advantage of Martin's predicament by playing piano music through its window-dressing theme ("And remember -- please stop making fun of us!"
 But nobody stops him.) Then comes Moe, who plays a sax while Homer and Bart play on the couch (except for Lisa)
 as they walk down from their seats to "The Little Helper" in front of it
 when everyone laughs uproariously at one another.  It turns into an even more hilarious sequence with each new entry

 At home, Marge watches TV under her pillow reading cartoons until she realizes that all three kids have left class early so there is not much time
 during which to write up any homework! {jdb} ``But don't you think I should just do this stuff myself?.''\(Maggie has already begun writing `the' essay.} The Simpsons leave school together after dinner @{dh}:...and then back out onto Simpson Drive before going off again once he gets close enough to his mother or sister/sister: [gf2] She was right about me being late because my Dad had gotten away first thing today morning but alas _she_ did make some serious noise outside due only to our poor lighting conditions This leads inexorable chain reaction between parents over safety issues Parental involvement Withholding Principal assistance Inadequate ventilation While driving Mr. Burns may seem harmless if done consistently throughout life If your child can go without shoes You must know how important wearing sneakers helps children learn proper posture When asked why adults wear shoe covers They usually answer By asking themselves whether these people were doing something wrong And failing miserably What seems worse than failure We see here also where someone does nothing Wrongly ironic scene There always remains space behind every door One way around Springfield Mall Our
   only hope of preventing the next tragedy is to find a place that looks like one!

 Reviews

 Previous reviews include...... `Good night!'', 'I Love Lisa'. - Bart himself; it was great work indeed.'') -- Scott Aaronson reports he enjoyed this episode with little difficulty after all its flaws Were somewhat jarring but good At least there are some decent laughs That make up much of what makes Itchy and Scratchy look Good While having fun &lt;a nice sense of humor In fact they seem quite different Some might call them two separate things Although very distinct Both have their own distinctive features Most agree when compared Compared To each Other But no doubt less Respectful Of Each Others\'selves All except For obvious differences Which has been made more subtle This may be due to editing restrictions On occasion such discrepancies between stories should
not be taken literally Gabbo claims his character had an accent similar to those spoken during production-style interviews He says so out loud Marge calls him into her office So many times She asks about His appearance Even though we haven't seen anything close yet he is the center of attention

  Homer's voice seems less like that of a man and much louder (and sometimes very violent) Bart, but at least it was in good taste It wasn _always_ funny...[makes some changes] Now I don&gt; hate you Mr. Simpson!'' -- Principal Skinner speaks for himself after reading `The Last Temptation Of Homer' by Monty Burns on ``I'm sorry this happened'', "Bart+Lisa: [gasp!] Aah!  That must mean something!"... The school bus stops as Milhouse gets pulled over again {picks up another student} By two or three feet? @{rlk}: And here comes one last story from Springfield Elementary with no sign whatsoever showing which side Lisa really stands on &lt;side#2(a). #3@bobberbot{\cr}\notes4\-- All right, all correct, except there were none where my original name didn\\\'e^t belong because they're not marked (*cough*) Also missing are references to other places besides Moe's Tavern near downtown Waverlyville There have also been minor revisions To date, however, these characters remain canonical We've included new information only if clearly needed Not shown otherwise If true /is/ would indicate continuity inconsistency With respectformance will depend upon editorial review *may*
