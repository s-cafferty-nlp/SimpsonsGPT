 EPISODE TITLE: Maggie is a Ghost (EPISODE SUMMARY:                    [in the middle of the night]
EPISODE SUMMARY:  Permission denied.  Time: 8:00]

 EPISODE SUMMARY:   Permission denied. _Bart_ and Lisa are asleep on the couch watching TV.

   -- Bart, ``''
  
 Bart wakes up in bed with Marge, who has just awakened from an hour-long sleepover.  The television turns off, and Homer looks out the window at the house
 and sees a huge sign reading "Gentlemen's Club.''  Lisa says that she thinks they're friends.  She then walks to the door
 and opens it.

 Bart and Lisa walk inside, but there's no one outside.  They look around nervously, but nobody seems to notice
 the sign.  Bart calls for help, and Lisa responds, ``I think I've got some bad news.  You can't get away without a gun.''

 Bart tells Bart he'll go see his psychiatrist, but Lisa insists he stay.  He decides to
 tell her what's wrong.  Bart explains that he'd like to have a talk with him.  But Lisa refuses, and
 Homer goes into the bathroom and shuts the door behind them.  Lisa asks if Bart really wants to talk, and Bart replies, ``Well, maybe not.
 We should be friends!''  Lisa continues to ask, ``But you won't win my heart...''

 Bart takes a picture of Moe's Tavern, which appears to be a bar, and shows it off in his
 bedroom.  The kids are amazed that they can see him standing at the front door with a sign reading ``Love & Loss.''  He then turns
 inside and begins kissing himself.  A voice on the other end of the phone calls, "Hello!"
 Marge says, ``You're so nice!  Love is something I have to do with love.''  She hands him the photo and walks away.
 Meanwhile, Marge tries to convince Homer to come back to her house.  When she does, he refuses.  But when Homer comes home from work,
 he spots Marge walking up to him in her kitchen doorway.  ``I need some more love," he cries, "and this one will make me feel good about myself."
 Burns imagines Marge looking out the window, but she just stares
 at him as he runs over to the door and grabs her by the arm.  Marge pulls the plug.  Homer opens the fridge, and Marge
 tells Homer, ``We've got a problem: we don't know what our family has been eating for
 years.''  Smithers sees Homer approaching the door with a bottle of water, and wonders if he'd like to drink
 the beer instead.  Homer offers to go upstairs, but Smithers insists, ``No, Dad, I'm not going downstairs.''  Homer
 begs, ``Moe's Tavern sucks,'' and smashes the glass down the stairs, knocking Lisa unconscious.  Burns
 pushes Marge aside, and Marge explains that Marge was a bad mother and she didn't want to be around her kids.

 Homer wakes up at home in bed with his family.  He looks at his watch, then sees Marge on the TV...

 Bart arrives at the bar and starts playing music.  At the end of each track, Bart sings "Sweet Home Alabama"
 for the first time.  Marge is pleased that Homer has been able to stay away from them all night.
 The next morning, Homer plays the saxophone while Marge watches TV.  She notes that they're still watching TV, but Homer
 wants to get out of here.  Homer asks how much money can you make?
 Marge says $20 million!  It seems like it could cost $500,000.  Then Homer
 suggests taking him into the casino to gamble.  But Marge refuses, saying that there are too many people who don't understand gambling.  ``You've got to
 play hard,'' she tells him, ``you know, just keep your mouth shut.''  Bart agrees.
 Homer goes inside, but Marge warns him that Marge won't let him leave without paying
 the bills.  ``Homer, stop this thing!''  Marge calls Homer over.
 Marge gets dressed, but Homer doesn't notice until he reaches the casino floor.  Bart
 shows off his new casino-like casino room and begins singing, ``Lovejoy's
 Casino'', as Marge takes him in.  As he sits in the booth, Marge gives him the cash prize,
 then asks, ``Where's that?''

 At the casino, a crowd of tourists cheers with enthusiasm.  The
 casino is filled with people looking at each other.  Marge looks up to see a group of kids
 laughing hysterically at her husband's gambling machine.  "Homer, you're not going anywhere," she whispers.
 ``It'll be great fun.''  She turns back around and sees Lisa standing behind the counter,
 watching it from above.  "I'm sure we could make something really good for your money, sir!" she says.
 Lisa laughs maniacally, then runs off down the street.  When everyone returns,
 she walks out with a huge pile of money, and they all laugh uproariously.  (``Oh, I got a little more luck than you guys did!")
 In the casino, a man comes by and starts selling tickets to
 some of the guests.  He offers $50,000 for each ticket sold, but Marge insists on paying for
 one seat on the casino floor, so he buys two seats next to her.  ``You can play poker, but only if you pay for
 me,'' he announces.  A woman in a dress approaches and kisses him, who grabs a piece of paper and
 writes "$50,000" on it.

 Outside, Marge watches TV while Bart plays cards on his computer.  The game continues...
   
   Moe: Well, what are you doing here?
   Burns: Oh, my God.  [laughs] I'm going to have to play the lottery!
   Lisa: And we can't get any more money out of this.
   -- ``''
  
 Homer takes another gamble, but Smithers is still gambling with her.  He pays $500 for
 the winnings and gives her $100.  Smithers asks for the cash, and she agrees.  She
 gets a little angry at him.  Smithers: You don't _have_ enough cash, Homer.
  Homer: No, no, I just won't be losing anything.  I mean, I got two million dollars today, so
        I'm not gonna lose that much.
Smithers: OK, fine, okay, now go back to your old ways, kids.
   -- ``''
  
 In Springfield, Smithers tries to convince Lisa to take him over as his bettor, but Lisa refuses.  Smithers
 tells Lisa she's wrong about everything.  ``Oh, well, good luck.  But I'll never forget.''  Smithers leaves
 and returns to the casino.  At the casino, he offers to sign up for an autograph contest, but Lisa declines.
  
  Smithers: Look, Dad, when I was in college, I had a big idea.  I'd show everyone how to beat
             a man who didn't even have a name.
  Homer: [giggles] No, no, you don't!  You know what's funny? The guy has his own way of talking,
        and he can tell me exactly what he thinks I'm doing.
-- Bart is too busy writing letters, 

Smithers walks out with the rest of the family.  "Hey," he says, "where are you going?"

Lisa asks him where he is going.
  
  Smithers: Here's your ticket: $50.00.
   -- Smithers explains the lottery, ``''

At the casino, Bart and Marge walk into a bar.  Smithers greets them, then goes back upstairs to get some cash.
  
   Bart: Hey, look at this.  This is my ticket.  It's got a million dollars on it.
   Lisa: Oh, come on, Smithers.  Don't worry, kids, I'll just give you one dollar every time.
 Smithers: {[giggles] What am I supposed to do about that?}
   Bart: Well, there's only one thing left to say: you're not gonna win anything, right?
 Smithers: Uh huh.
