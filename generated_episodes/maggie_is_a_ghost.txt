 In the living room, the kids watch television.  The TV news report is "The Springfield Daily News".  ``It's
a very interesting story.''  (Homer has been on the cover since he was just a baby.)  Homer asks for a picture of his
baby, but Bart can't believe what he's seeing.  He tells Homer that there's an old guy in town who thinks he
is going to kill himself.  But Marge doesn't understand.  ``That's _my_ baby.  I'm
going to die!''  Lisa says, ``I want you to be your father.  You're going to make me
your husband.  I don't need you any more.''  She kisses him.

 In bed, Lisa and Maggie look through the mirror, and they realize something terrible has happened.
 It's the same old guy: he's a baby.  His mother is gone, but his Dad is still alive.  Homer goes to the hospital.
 ``I've got to get my son out of here.''  Bart says that it's time to take a walk.  ``I don't want him to be a baby again.''
 Homer calls, ``Dad, I'll have my baby back!''  Homer says he will, and he drives home.  Marge
 reminds him that he must leave the house before he can go to school.  ``What if this guy wants to play?''  ``We're
all gonna have to go to Moe's Tavern!''  Marge assures Homer that she knows how
to get Bart to stop playing.  ``I'd like to see some good old-fashioned fun, but I'm afraid we
have to go to Moe's Tavern right now.''  Homer takes a seat at the table, and mumbles, ``I know
you won't find anything better than this.''  Marge suggests he sit down next to her, and Bart
 asks, ``What's it with you guys?''  Homer is taken off by the crowd, and
 they all cheer.

 The kids look on in awe as the game begins.  "Wow!" says Lisa, ``that was great.''  They take off their glasses, and
 Homer looks around for a way to get them back on.  ``That's not the worst thing about
this whole thing," he says, ``but it's still pretty cool.''  He spots a sign reading `Moe's Tavern' in
 the corner of a bar, and he imagines a picture of Moe sitting in the same place as the
 players.  He goes into the bar and sits down.  ``Oh, wait a minute, I thought I could make it _a_ little
funny by taking a sip of my beer.''  As they walk away, Homer sighs, ``So funny, Dad.''  (``And
so much more fun.'')  At Moe's Tavern, Moe's owner Bob tells his employees to keep an eye out for Moe.
 ``If I don't get Moe's Tavern tomorrow, I'll be gone for a while,'' says Bart, ``and I'll probably just
go home.  It'll be a big party.  And I want a little respect.  But I can't let my family get hurt.''  Homer
 continues, ``It's not about money, it's about being good.''

 At the Springfield Retirement Home, Bart and Lisa look at their old house, where Homer has a large sign
 that says ``Don't forget to come by for dinner tonight.''  Marge calls Homer to see what he's got in there, but
 Homer doesn't listen.  ``What are you talking about?'' asks Marge, ``The guy with the big sign!''  He
 turns around, and sees Ned's sign, which says, ``Eat &lt;your&gt; house.''  Homer eats a steak, but
 realizes he ate a steak too.  ``I'm gonna have to go down to the
 bar and drink some more!''  Bart is upset that Ned didn't pay him for the steak.  Marge reminds
 that Ned was paying for the steak anyway.  ``I thought I'd give you one last chance to prove me wrong.''  Homer
 orders Ned to sit down, and Ned responds, ``Hey, hey, hey!  You're getting a beer!''  Homer takes
 Ned to Moe's Tavern.  Moe gives him a drink, but Bart refuses.  ``I've never been so drunk in my life,
 I think I'll just take a sip of your beer.''  The crowd cheers, and everyone cheers again.  ``Oh,
 great!  Now I'm going to have to go through with this.  [tries to
 drink] Hey, look at that, man!  It's like a beer!''  Marge suggests they put on
 their jackets.  Homer asks Marge if she likes them, and she says no, and Marge adds, ``You know, I can't wait to see how it goes.''
 Marge invites Homer to the bar, but Homer doesn't want to get too attached to the idea.
 He thinks about what he should do with the money, and Marge suggests they try to make a few more
 sacrifices.  But Marge has a point, and Lisa is impressed.  ``If we don't stop drinking, then
 there's going to be nothing left for us to lose.''  Homer sits down to watch Moe's Tavern, but Marge tells
 him he's got to stay out of the way.  ``We need to make some sacrifices now, okay?''  ``And not tonight.''  She
 offers to buy Homer a beer, but Homer declines.  Marge suggests that they let him
 drink alone, and Homer reluctantly accepts.  Marge explains that they won't sell Bart any more,
 which makes Homer feel good about himself.

 At the tavern, Marge asks Homer if he wants to go over to the bar.  Homer answers, ``No.''
 (``I just want to be with you!'')

 On the phone, Homer tells Marge that he's going to have a good time.  He says that he
 loves his new girlfriend, but he has trouble staying awake.  He thinks it's
 because he's been so quiet lately.  ``I don't know how to say this, I've been thinking about
 my life for hours,'' he muses, ``and I can't help but get tired of it!''  The next day,
 he wakes up with the feeling of being in jail again.  ``That's great!''  Marge gives him a hug, but Homer isn't impressed.
 ``Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...''  Lisa sighs, but Marge reminds him that she
 is _really_ happy.  Marge continues to tell her story, until she gets an idea.  Homer tries to explain
 that he was trying to play the victim card at a bar when he put on his pants, but
 it's too loud and he's got a bad feeling.  ``Hey, maybe we should do something about that,'' she says, ``but
 what about the rest of us?''  Marge asks Homer to come to dinner, and Homer gladly does so.
 Homer sits in the back of the line, eating a sandwich.
