EPISODE TITLE: Lisa the Republican

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 Homer and Marge walk to a house where a woman is dressed in a pink dress.  She's talking about
   her new boyfriend, who's got a big problem.  He's a tall, muscular guy.  Bart thinks he
   should just go out of his way to make money, but Lisa says that if you're going to be
   your own boss, you need to do something for yourself.  It seems like they're all
   thinking of leaving.  They see the house on the side of the road and decide
   to leave.  The family are gathered around Homer.
   
   Marge: Dad, this is so sad.  We've been waiting for you all night for the perfect moment
           to get back together.  I can't believe we're still here.
         [Homer turns off the light]
           [the family leave with a tearful look]
   Homer: Mom!  Why didn't we come to dinner?  You were too nice to us!
             [they turn off the light]
            [they hear a noise from the house]
              [Homer pulls a switch and puts it on the table]
          [Marge looks worried]
   Homer: [sighs] Don't worry, Dad, I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
          [Homer gets into the car]
           [Bart is driving past a tree]
           [Homer drives past a house full of garbage]
Homer: [on the phone] Marge, this is going to be fun.  We don't have time to talk about it any more, but...
Marge: [reading the phone] Hello, Bart.  Hello, Homer.  How are you?
Homer: I'm good, man.
Marge: Well, I've got some questions for you.  What's your name?
Homer: Uh, Homer.
            [Homer walks towards him]
Marge: [reads the phone] Hey, Homer, what's your name?
Homer: Homer Simpson.
Marge: Oh, Homer, I thought I'd just say hi.
Homer: [writing his name in a letter] Hi, Homer.
             [Homer writes down his name]  Hello, Homer.
Homer: [reading the phone] Hey, Homer.
-- Homer, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 20:06]

At home, Homer is reading the mail.  ``Oh, it's not funny.  It's sad.  It's sad to see my son so depressed.
But I'll do anything to make things better.''  He takes out a large stack of envelopes and reads them.  (``Hello, Homer.  Hello, Homer.  Hello, Homer.  Hello, Homer.'')
He notices that the letters have been replaced by `D' on them.  ``Hey!  D'!''
He opens a new envelope, and finds a note from Marge.

 Homer: I want to give you this letter because I think you're going to miss me.  I'm sorry, but I _don't_ want to
             lose you.
           [Homer turns around, looks at the letter]
Homer: [writing] Dear Marge, I am writing this letter for your love, for my best friend, and for your best friend,
           Lisa,
         [he's in the middle of writing it, then stops]
Marge: You don't need a letter, son.  Just take a look at this little piece of paper...
         [he reads it]
Homer: It's just a letter, sir.  Please write down your name, address, and phone number.
-- A very good idea, 

The next day, Marge is busy reading her letter.

 Homer: Oh, Bart.  Your letter has been delivered.  And now you've got the chance to express yourself through it.
Marge: Oh, Dad, what an idea!  This is so sweet.  I can't wait to hear it again.
Homer: [reading it] My first words are, "I wish I could say this more often."
Marge: What?  [reading it]  Oh, Dad, you really should read it.
Homer: Yes, it's funny.  But it's also true: I wish I could say it more often.
-- Homer learns his new word for love, "Two Dozen &amp; One Greyhounds"

At home, Homer talks to Bart about his letter.

Homer: You know, if you ever want to be with someone who loves you unconditionally, you're going to have to get a letter from me.
 Bart: It's not like that.  There's a big difference between a letter and a letter.
Homer: No.
-- Not even in this country, 

The family go to bed.  Marge tells them they'll just have to take the letter home and leave it at home.

Homer: [reading it] Dear Mr. Burns,
   I am very sorry for the inconvenience.  You will not receive your letter until tomorrow.
Homer: OK, good.  If there is a reason you didn't send it to me, I will.
-- Homer reads his letter, 

Homer wakes up at 3am and finds himself asleep on the couch.

 Homer: [reading it] Dear Mr. Burns,
   I am very sorry for inconveniencing you.
Homer: Well, maybe I'm right, but I'm not quite sure why I _should_ have sent this letter.
-- The two don't talk much, 

Marge asks Bart if he's going to go to bed now.

Marge: You know, Lisa, I think that would be great.  I can't believe you're sleeping in my own
     room!  It's so cold outside, even the light's coming from the chimney.
Homer: Oh, yeah, okay.  Now just relax, and listen to the sound of the fireplace.
-- Marge, after all these years, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 20:38]

 At breakfast, Marge tells Homer that she wants to make sure everyone knows her true feelings.  Homer looks around, sees Maggie
 standing in the middle of the kitchen, and sighs, "Oh, Dad."  She tosses him some toast.  Homer sits back down and
smiles.

Homer: [whining] I guess I should have put a little more effort into it.  Maybe I'll find a way to sleep with you
        tonight.
Marge: [grabs Bart's hand] I want you to remember I love you.
Homer: Yeah, I do, Mom.
Marge: [whines] I hope you get along with me, too.
