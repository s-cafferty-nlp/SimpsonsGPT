EPISODE TITLE: Lisa the Republican

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer is in his bedroom, listening to a song.  He sees a billboard advertising the
 "Lisa's Love" album and decides to take it down.  ``I'm going to be mad if I ever get my
 first single.''

 Meanwhile, Bart is sitting on the couch reading a book.  ``Hey, you're so funny!''  Marge tells him she has an
 idea.  She invites him to watch the show, but he refuses.  (``It's just too stupid')
 Homer tries to make a joke of himself by playing with a toy gun.
 ``Oh, no!  It's just...it's like...the best thing you could do for me was play with a toy gun.''  But
 he gets caught up in his own cartoon antics.  The kids run off laughing at his antics.  Homer
 says, ``That's what I love about cartoons, isn't it?''  Marge suggests that they try out
 some more
 new things, then asks, ``What are you talking about?''  Moe explains how
 he got into the game, and Bart laughs evilly.  ``Homer, there's only one way to go
 when you have to kill your wife.  You've got to stop eating the meatball!''  Bart
 goes over to her, grabs her hand, and throws it at her head.  ``Don't eat any meatballs!" he screams,
 knocking her off the couch.  ``You can't win this game without winning.''  Marge calls out ``No
 other way.''  A voice outside warns them not to touch the meatball.  They
 leave, leaving Homer alone.  Homer thinks, ``Wow, that makes sense!  We should have won the game!
 Now let's put our money where our mouth is.''  He walks away from the casino, and
 leaves Bart alone in his room.

 Homer wakes up in the middle of the night with a stomach ache.  Itchy has been eating dinner all night.
 Lisa comes over, and she explains her predicament: She's having trouble sleeping at night.
 ``I'm so tired!''  ``What's wrong, Dad?''  ``Itchy wants you to tell him how bad it is...''
 Lisa tells him he needs to get back on his feet.  ``Just give me some rest.''  ``If I ever feel like going to bed again, just take it easy.''
 Lisa agrees.  The next morning, they're still asleep.  At home, they sit down for a
 breakfast.  "Bart's gone," says Lisa, ``and now I want to make sure we don't wake him up too late.''
 ``Good thing I didn't eat anything last night,'' says Bart, ``that was better.''  ``And if I could be any smarter, I'd say go ahead.''
 Lisa gets into bed.  Homer watches TV as she eats a sandwich.  Bart
 sits by himself on the couch.  ``That's good, Mom.  You've got plenty of time.''

 Homer arrives at the casino.  Inside, everyone is talking about their respective gambling losses.
 Bart asks, ``Is it really OK to gamble on the side of the road?''
 ``Yeah, but what's your bet, Mom?'' ``Uh, $1,000!''

 At home, Marge and Lisa talk to Bart.  ``I'm sure you're a big gambler,'' she says.
 ``Homer, I'd be surprised if you didn't have a lot of money in your bank account.
 But there's no way I could spend it without risking my life.''

 Bart gets out of bed.  "It was fun," he says, as Marge walks into his room.  The TV is on, and Bart
 watches with fascination as Marge plays with her phone.  She calls him again, and then tells him that she wants to play for him.  He
 responds, ``Mmm...no, I don't know.  It's just a game.''  Then she puts her phone away, turns it off, and goes back inside.  She
 finds herself playing ``The Game of Life'' instead of ``The Game of Death.''  (``You can die tomorrow''?)  She
 laughs nervously, then sighs, ``Good luck.''  Marge leaves, and Homer takes her to the hospital.  Bart has been diagnosed with cancer,
 and Lisa is concerned.  ``Hey Dad, we all love our family.  We need to get rid of them!''  Marge tries
 to reassure her, ``If they do, they won't survive.'''  They are both left alone together.  Bart
 gives her an explanation: ``Well, maybe we should give up gambling altogether.''  Marge
 suggests they start making other purchases.  Homer offers $50,000, but she declines.
 At the casino, Marge is amazed to see that everyone in the room
 has a poker face.  ``Oh my God, I'm so lucky!  [gasps] Oh my God!''  She
 tells Lisa and Lisa that their money's gone.  But it doesn't matter because nobody can buy it for
 less than what it cost.  The chips go back into the casino, and Marge
 pays $2 million to settle her debt.  She walks out with the cash on her
 hands.

 In bed, Lisa watches the TV show ``Bart and Lisa's Lawyer-Free Zone'' (``The
 Show') on the television monitor.  Bart sits on his couch while Marge plays the saxophone.
 Lisa asks him if he was right, but he says ``no''.  He leaves again, this time to watch ``A Little Helper'',
 which is titled ``The Good Samaritan\'s Guide to Better Legal
 Justice'.  Bart takes off his jacket, and Maggie looks at the television.  It shows
 ``Lawyer-Free Zone''.  ``I think you're going to be OK,'' she says.  ``And I know how much you'll save.''
 Bart goes home, then returns to work.  Bart explains that he will not have enough legal advice.
 Bart does not want to lose any more money, however, since he already lost $500 on
 a gambling card.  A friend calls him over to say he wants to take the bet.  He is
 convinced it is fair.

 Lisa and Marge are in bed at home watching TV.  "I'm getting out of here!" they cry, and
 Homer's face lights up with joy.  It looks like a little boy who has been playing
 for years...but no one seems to notice.  At dinner, Lisa gets her husband a plate of
 ice cream.  She orders it to go down to breakfast and makes a note.  The kids laugh as
 the dessert arrives.  As Lisa finishes eating, a man walks by and tells her to stop.  He
 grabs her hand and kisses her cheek.  But she pulls away from him.  Then his hands get bigger and bigger,
 and he runs off, leaving Lisa alone in bed.

 Homer wakes up in the morning and sees Marge staring at a picture of Bart.  "Mmm, my God," he
 grins.  His head snaps back into place, but he doesn't look happy.  Marge asks if he
 likes it, and he answers: "No."  "Well, don't you think we should leave now?"

 Homer leaves school early.  Marge tries to cheer him up.  ``Yeah, sure, Dad!''
 Marge invites him to watch the Simpsons' halftime show.  Homer plays ``The Little Big House on Ice Cream'' on
 television.  Marge watches through the window while Marge reads the news.  Homer
 sits next to Marge, holding a sign that says ``Marge's Back''.

 At home, Bart is watching "The Simpsons Movie" with Lisa and Milhouse.  They are seated
 in front of the TV.  Bart tells Lisa she has an appointment for her son.  She looks around nervously.
 ``I'm just going to be here until I get it.''  ``But wait!''  Lisa turns away.  Bart
 asks why she isn't getting it.  ``Oh, because he was born too young.  So I'll go see my dad.''  Lisa
 answers, ``Well, you've got to tell me something about yourself before we start talking.''  But
 she doesn't hear back from him.  ``You're not going to make any money if you don't have kids.''

 In the kitchen, Bart eats his breakfast.  A plate of pancakes sits beside his bed,
 filled with butter and sugar.  It smells good.  Lisa suggests he try eating some of it.  Bart reluctantly
 agrees.  ``Hey, let's eat it together,'' he whispers, but he can't do it without
 choking.  He gets into the car and drives off.  The family drive by...

 On the bus, Lisa walks out of the house and stops at a local bar.  There, she sees a man walking past.

 Lisa: What?  That guy's looking for us?
Homer: Yeah, I think he's a little old.  Maybe he'd like one of those `Bart' sandwiches.
