EPISODE TITLE: Tales of Ancient Springfield

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer and Marge watch a TV advertisement for a new ``family sitcom''.

 Homer has a family meeting.  Bart's father is on the phone with
 his wife, who tells him they want to meet his son.  Lisa asks, ``I've got some problems
 with my brother.''  Homer responds, ``He's an idiot!''

 At home, Homer and Marge sit in their bedroom.  Homer says he wants to get out of
 school, but Marge reminds him it's all up to him.  He goes into
 a dream about how he'll be able to go out of the way if he
 chooses to.  (``If I don't get out of school, I'll have to do something I hate!'')
 Marge suggests that they go see a movie at home, so Homer decides to play his own
 game.  Marge invites Homer to watch ``My Little Pony
 Movie''.  Homer thinks it's funny, then realizes what it really means.  He imagines himself as a
 ``dude'' with a big pony tail and a big head, and a big head and a big pony tail and a big head and a big pony tail.
 But when Marge introduces him to the movie, she explains that it's just a ``little
 fun'', because he can play it any way he likes, including with a pony tail.
 Marge suggests they go see ``The Twilight Zone''.  Homer muses, ``It's not like
you're going to be doing anything special...''  The kids cheer.  ``Oh, well, we could _probably_ have fun.''  Meanwhile,
 Marge tries to convince Homer to take a job at a company that pays more than
 $50,000 a year.  Homer doesn't want to work, and Marge offers him a job at
 the plant.  (``I'm sure I'll get a good one someday.'')  He accepts.

 At home, Bart is having a hard time sleeping, but Lisa insists on making him sleep through the night.  Bart
 has trouble sleeping in bed, so Marge suggests he just leave his pillow to
 his mother, who agrees.  ``Well, maybe some of that will help.  Maybe you'll find something
that makes you feel better about yourself.''  Marge suggests they sit down for dinner.
 They do so, but Homer wakes up and cries uncontrollably.  She asks if he wants to talk to her, and Bart responds, ``Don't worry, Mom.  I know what I can do for you!
 But I'm afraid you don't think I can change the world for the better.''  Marge tells Homer to get out of bed, but
 he refuses.  ``You've got to stay awake all night,'' says Marge, and she leaves.  Bart
 wakes up and looks worried.  ``What happened?''  Marge wonders if he really does
 want to talk to her, but Homer insists that he'll just give her a kiss.  ``We're both
free.'', and he kisses her again.  Marge tells Bart he can't let himself get too attached to his
 daughter, but he thinks about leaving the house for a while.
 At home, Bart talks to Lisa on the phone.

 The family watch TV.  ``Oh, I'm going to have to stop by to see what's going on in
 here.''  (The kids' eyes turn red.)  Lisa asks Homer why he's not taking them out to dinner.
 ``Well, I don't know,'' says Bart.  ``I guess it's just a matter of time before we learn how
 much
 you love me.''  Bart is taken away from the family by his mother.
 He tries to explain that he doesn't need money, but Marge reminds him that they're still free.  ``I
 am, after all, a human being.''  Homer continues, ``And this isn't even the most popular show on
 TV!''  Marge calls Bart's father, who answers, ``No!''  ``You're going to make us
 happy.  It's just a matter of time before we learn how much you love me.''  ``Good-bye, Dad.''  ``Happy birthday,
 Happy birthday, Happy birthday, Happy birthday, Happy birthday, Happy birthday.''  The music changes to
 ``Bart vs. Marge: What's the difference?'', and the family laugh uproariously.  ``That was
the most fun I ever had.''  Lisa thanks Bart for making things right.  "Thank you, Mom!" she cries,
 as Homer walks in with an invitation.  She takes off her glasses and puts them on.
 (``I'm so proud of you, Bart!'')

 At Moe's Tavern, Barney and Smithers are drinking beer, while Burns sits down.  He has a drink, but he doesn't want to go too far,
 because they're having a hard time finding a seat.  Meanwhile, Marge is enjoying herself at home.  Marge tells
 everyone that Bart's got a new friend, and it's Lisa.  ``Hey, look at all these other girls!  [sniffs] I thought you were gonna make fun of my
 old friend, Smithers,'' she continues.  ``You really _are_ a good person!''  Bart asks if it's
 his new friends, and Smithers says, ``Oh yeah?''  But Bart can't see him coming.  ``I've been trying to think of a
 plan.  I just don't know.''  Marge suggests they stay up late to play the drums, which Homer agrees.
 Homer leaves with Marge and Lisa.  They sing their song, ``Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday''.  Homer
 looks around, and sees that there are no kids in the bar.  ``Well, maybe not any more than I thought.''  A man in a
 dress walks out of the bar.

 In bed, Marge tells Bart she's going to get her hair done.  She says it will be better if
 he was wearing a ponytail.  Bart is impressed, but Marge insists that his hair is
 beautiful.  The next morning, Marge gives Homer a massage.  ``Oh, you can do this, Dad,'' she says,
 but the doctor tells him to relax and rest.  Homer does so, and Marge explains that he has a special
 condition called ``the hair follicles.''  He imagines himself as a little boy, with a ponytail and hair, but
 it doesn't look good for his hair.  "I'm going to have to go to a psychiatrist to see what _is_
 this," she reminds him, and he laughs uproariously.  ``But I'll never have hair like this again.''  Marge
 tells Homer she needs some help.  ``I'm sure we're going to find something...''  Marge offers a hand-made
 doll to Bart.  Homer reluctantly accepts.  (``That's my best friend,'' he sighs.)  But
 when he opens the doll, the hair is missing from his face.  It's a ponytail, and Bart's eyelashes are
 covered in it.  ``I wish I had a pony tail!  It's like a big, happy, proud boy.''  Marge suggests
 that Homer go see the pony tail museum.  He says they'll be back soon enough, but
 Lisa refuses to let him stay at home.  ``He's not even wearing a pony tail.''

 The next day, the family drive down to Springfield Harbor for dinner.  Homer sits in the front row with Marge.
 ``So, what do you think of this?'' asks Marge.  ``It's just a little too expensive.''  Homer answers, ``I can't afford that.''  Marge
 tells Homer he should have gotten a pony tail, but Homer says he could get one if he'd bought a pony tail.
 ``But now I don't want to be tied up in a pony tail.''  ``You've got me, Dad.  You've got to learn to love yourself more.''  Marge
 suggests he check out the pony tail museum, which has a plaque saying ``The pony tail
 museum.''  Marge adds, ``We've got an exhibit about the pony tail.''  Homer
 explains he likes the pony tail because it's a good thing he's getting a pony tail, but Marge points out
 that there's no pony tail.  ``If you look at it as a kid, I wouldn't mind having a pony tail.
