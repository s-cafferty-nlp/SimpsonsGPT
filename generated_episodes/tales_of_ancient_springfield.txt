EPISODE TITLE: Tales of Ancient Springfield

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer and Bart are in the kitchen, watching TV.  Lisa says something to her husband about a show called ``Bart's
 Homey'', which she likes, but Homer tells her it was just a show about
 their son's father.  The Simpsons watch the show, then they get up.  Homer walks out with his family and
 introduces them to the show's title.

 At home, Marge asks if anyone is looking for a new host.  She suggests
 that everyone should go see a movie where people sing along.  "I don't like
 this," says Homer.  He turns off the television, then opens the door.  Inside, he finds himself surrounded by
 kids.  All laugh uproariously as they play the saxophone.  One girl
 sings "Happy Birthday, Mommy!" while the other plays "Happy Birthday, Dad" at the same time.

 As Marge watches from the kitchen window, Homer gets up and begins singing ``Happy Birthday, Dad''

 At home, Marge asks what happened to him.  ``It's over,'' she responds, ``but I'm going to have my day.''  She leaves
 her room and heads downstairs.  When she arrives, she sees Homer playing the saxophone.  A few children cheer
 around on the living room floor.  They all look up when Marge shows them a picture of Moe Simpson.

 Homer sits next to Marge.  Marge calls Homer a little boy.  "Hey! What's your name?  You're so nice," he replies,
 "you can call me Mr. Burns."  She laughs and smiles.  Marge goes upstairs to check on Marge.  It looks like Marge has
 been eating
 some junk food lately.  Marge tries to make up for the fact that she ate it in bed.  Bart is
 surprised by the way she says it, but Lisa insists she don't have any more junk food left.
 ``Marge, you know I'm not going to get sick of this.''  Homer asks her if she
 wants to eat anything else.
 ``No.  No one will ever forget how good it was when I got my first taste of
 meat.''  Lisa tells him she likes it, and then she starts walking down the hall.

 At the cafeteria, Homer sits at his desk with Patty.  He notices Patty is wearing a pink sweater,
 as does everyone else.  ``Oh, hello Patty, what are you doing here?''  Patty asks where he is going.  ``I need to take a walk,''
 Patty answers, ``and see where I can find something new to do.''  They head into the dining room and sit around
 watching TV.  As they watch, Patty comes up with another idea.  ``Maybe we should give her a treat.''  She
 walks past Patty, who grabs a pizza and opens it, but Patty stops her.  The kids
 laugh uproariously.  ``Homer, I thought you'd be happy about that!  That's just...
 wonderful!  I love all these people!''  Patty explains she loves them all.  ``You'll never go back to school again.''  Patty
 gets out of bed, pulls out a book, and reads it.  A man in the audience says, ``Who is this guy?  He's
 my favorite movie ever!''  Marge asks him to tell her what he saw, but
 Homer refuses to answer.  ``He's not going to let me get on his bad side,'' he tells her.  ``I'm sorry, Dad.''

 In the kitchen, Bart shows Lisa his new toy, which she can use for
 ``making fun of everyone''.  Bart goes to pick up some
 candy for the family and eats it.  Meanwhile, Patty and Marge are having a picnic outside.
 ``Itchy and Scratchy!'' exclaims Patty as they watch the fireworks from the
 window.  ``That was good!  We got a big crowd here, so we were gonna
 eat it too!'' Marge imagines the scene playing out at the Springfield Funhouse.
 Patty and Marge sit down at the table with their children.  Marge calls for Maggie to take off her
 dress, but Patty does so and walks away.  As the music continues, the children gasp in surprise.
 At home, Patty looks around frantically, then realizes she has no idea how
 she ended up there.  She runs upstairs with her parents and cries.  "What happened?"
 ``Well, maybe I should have told her," mumbles Marge.  ``Just because something didn't work doesn't mean
 it wasn't wrong."  She grabs her phone and dials 911.  ``The Simpsons'
 house is burning down.''

 Homer's car pulls away from the scene of the crime scene.  He drives off in a hurry to pick up some
 paper.  The cops are on the scene at the front door.
 (``It's time to get out!'')  They pull back behind the wheel and see Lisa running
 into the driveway.  A police car pulls up next to her, but Bart can't see it.

 As Lisa gets out, he sees that his family members are all gone.
 ``You got any money left?'' he asks as they walk by.  ``I think we'll be fine.''

 Meanwhile, Maggie walks over to Moe's Tavern.  It's empty.  ``Hey, you gotta go somewhere else.  We're
 looking for people who could help us pay our bills.''  She spots a sign advertising an open bar called ``The


Bart & Moe Tavern'' which has a sign reading, ``All right, let's drink here.''  But before she does so, she
 spills a beer onto the floor of the tavern.  `No one will ever hear me say anything negative about
 this place.  And if anybody did, what would they do?'', says Maggie.  ``We'd kill each other.'''  Smithers
 tells him to stop drinking.

 At home, Bart sits down to watch TV and plays the latest episode of ``Homer
 Goes to the Next Pageant''.  When Homer wakes up, he looks around frantically.  There are
 three cars parked outside the bar with no one inside, but Marge's husband is out in the open.
 ``I'll just sit here for a minute.''  He walks over and sees his wife
 staring at them.  ``You're not supposed to be doing this?'' she asks angrily.  `Why would you want to
 ask me about something so trivial?'''  She pulls a gun from her pocket and fires it
 into Springfield Harbor, where Homer finds himself on a pier.  ``It's like that!''

 Meanwhile, Lisa watches TV as Marge runs off.  The family
 ride through the streets looking for their son.

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 7:33]

 In the parking lot, Lisa takes some photos while watching television.  As Marge
 gets back to work, she removes a photo of Homer.  It shows the two kids standing naked in front of a
 fire.  ``That's right!  That's what we were talking about,'' she observes.

 A man in the car drives past, who turns around to look at the two children sitting
 next to him.  ``Look at those little faces!'' he whispers.  They all laugh.  Marge
 smiles sadly, and Homer laughs nervously.  ``Oh, yeah, I know!  But I thought they were good friends...''  Marge
 calls out, ``Hey, Dad, can you help me see my son?''
   
 Homer sighs, and he points towards the house.  Marge has been playing
 with his new toy.

 Homer walks in.  "What's going on here?" asks Lisa.  She
 tells him that Bart is getting a new toy for Christmas.  He answers, "No!"
 Then he says, "Well, I don't think we've ever seen each other before.''  The
 kids look at each other, then back to where their parents left off.  A
 treehouse scene plays outside.  At first, it looks like Homer's home is under construction.
 Bart sees Bart sitting in the yard, looking up from the treehouse.  ``Homer, what did you say?''

Homer takes the toy to show its owner.  It shows him the original model of Homer's
 head.  Homer imagines Homer having sex with a doll, but he doesn't get the idea.  When
 Bart comes over, he grabs the toy and throws it at Lisa.  Lisa screams in shock, and
 cries, ``Whoa!  This is so sweet!''
 Homer watches TV, which is filled with cartoons of children playing with toys.
 Lisa gets up and starts dancing around the house.  Bart tosses her into the air, and she
 collapses to the floor.  Meanwhile, Homer is watching television, reading a book.  His eyes widen when
 he notices an elephant on the ground.  `Wow!', he thinks to himself, ``I'm just glad I didn't kill him.
