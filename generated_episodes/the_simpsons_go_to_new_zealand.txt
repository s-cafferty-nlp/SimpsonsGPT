EPISODE TITLE: The Simpsons go to New Zealand

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Lisa wanders into the Springfield library and sees a sign with a picture of Homer on it.  She
reads "Bart Gets A Job" in the front window, then reads ``Homer Goes To New Zealand'' next to
 the photo.  Bart is shocked when he sees that his job title says ``Work''.  He asks for
 some help finding a job.

 Meanwhile, Homer has been working at the Kwik-E-Mart since 9am.  When he wakes up, he finds
 Marge sitting on her bed reading a book, but she's already asleep.  At
the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer tells Marge he needs money because he can't afford to get out of
his car.

 As they wait outside, Marge explains she didn't pay any attention to the signs until after
they got there.  Marge suggests Lisa take a look at those signs...

 Lisa tries to sleep at home, but Homer stops her from
moving.  Marge reminds her she should just leave him alone.  Marge
 continues to read, but Homer starts crying uncontrollably.  Marge grabs him by the hair and pulls him back
 away.  Burns walks over to see what Marge thinks.  Marge looks down and spots
her face covered in tears, then turns around and cries, ``I'll never forget you.''  Smithers takes
out the sign and runs off.  Marge calls out, ``You know I'm going to need this money!''

 Lisa returns to work.  Marge gets an appointment at Moe's.  Marge
 offers to give Homer the money if he pays the bill.  Homer refuses, and Marge gives
him the check.  Homer agrees.  Marge hands Homer a note saying he must keep his mouth shut, but
he doesn't take it, and he leaves.  She says she will go see her husband tomorrow.  He asks for a ride home,
and they make their way down the road.  "I'll be right back," he says, "with my family."
 At Moe's, Bart tells Maggie how much he loves her.  The two walk into the
restaurant, where Bart is waiting on the floor, with Marge in his arms.  When
they reach the front door, Bart opens it, and sees Marge holding him up by the throat.
 ``Homer, you're lucky we didn't get your wallet stolen.''  Homer takes
her hand and kisses her, then walks away.  Marge watches from afar as Bart
tries to kiss Homer again, but when Marge reaches for it, she pulls it out of his
mouth and starts kissing it.  It's not long before Marge begins sucking on it.  As
she goes inside, Homer looks around frantically, and Marge grabs his hand and
pulls it open.  "Hey, what are you doing here?  You don't even have a phone!" he exclaims,
calling her ``Oh, that sucks!''
 Marge laughs and holds her head, which is covered in blood.  She turns
into a giant red blob.  She hugs him tightly, then runs off.  Marge tries to hug him, but
the weight of the whole thing makes her scream.  "Don't worry," she says, "I'm going to go get my
pregnancy test.''

 Bart goes out into the field for a walk.  The sun shines brightly on his face.  He
looks around nervously.  ``What's wrong, Mom?  I can see your eyes.''  Homer
takes it easy, and asks if Lisa has any idea where he got this
exotic-looking eye.  ``Uh, no...no...no, nothing!'' he says,
and walks away.  As he approaches his family, Homer looks over at Maggie.  A
little boy with curly hair sits atop his shoulder.  ``Hey, what are you talking about?''  He
calls back, ``Maggie!'' and smiles sadly.  ``Well, uh, well, maybe we should call some
people up."  Homer leaves, but they all turn their heads and laugh.

At home, Homer gets a new pair of sneakers, and calls them ``Bart Simpson &amp;s'',
which make him look like Bart Simpson.  Itchy comes in with a bag of peanuts, and Bart
wants him to buy it.  ``Yeah, yeah, good luck,'' he says, as he takes
it down the street, and Bart tosses it aside.  ``You've been looking awfully bad for _that_ time.
But hey, I guess you'll be OK, Dad.  If you ever need me again, I'll take care of that."
 Homer goes to bed, but Marge doesn't come back until after midnight.

 [End of Act Three.  Time: 20:16]

 At the Springfield Funeral Home, Maggie and Lisa are buried together on the floor of their
removable grave.

 In the cemetery, Homer is still alive, but his heart has stopped beating.  He sighs heavily
and looks at his son.

 Marge walks out from under the tombstone and sees Marge's grave covered in blood.

 She hugs Homer.  "Marge, what happened?" she asks.

 Marge explains that she didn't see her husband die because he was
too sick to go to the funeral.  ``I mean, no," she answers.  ``It was all about my health.''  Marge
 laughs, then returns to the grave and kisses Homer.  The two hug.  They kiss briefly.  Marge calls
 ``Homer!'' and leaves.  A nurse holds an autograph of Marge.

 As they walk up the steps of the cemetery, Homer hears Marge sing a song.  ``Hey, Marge!''
 Homer sings along.  Marge tells Homer that when he died, he'd never have been able to
be alone again.  She suggests that he give up his life of crime, but Homer refuses.  ``No!''
 Homer agrees, and begins singing ``Lovely'', which he does just once before
 the end.

 Bart plays with Lisa's hair in the pool while Marge dances on the beach.  A photo of Marge
 is shown.  It shows her dressed as the girl who got shot at Simpson's house...
 [End of Act Three.  Time: 7:38]

 The family watch TV for a few minutes.  Homer asks Marge if she likes him, and she says no.  Marge then explains that she loves him
 more than anything else, and she would like to get married.  But Homer doesn't seem interested, so Marge
 walks off to play the guitar.

 Marge sits in the kitchen, watching television.  At home, Maggie watches cartoons from the
 floorboards.  "I love you," she whispers.  "You're my sweetheart."  When Marge leaves, she calls out, ``Whoa!''
 Homer answers, ``Marge?''

 As Marge returns home, Bart sees her playing the guitar with Marge in bed.
 ``Aw, I can't believe it's you,'' she cries, and Marge tries to reassure her.  Marge turns away, but
 she continues to play, and Homer takes her seat next to her.  He picks her up, and they kiss.
 Marge smiles and kisses her goodbye.

 Marge looks through the window and notices that the kids are asleep.  Marge opens the door.  Inside,
 she finds herself sitting on a couch with a blanket over her head.  Her eyes open wide, and she sees Bart
 walking out of the kitchen in his underwear.  "Oh...my sweetie," she says cheerfully.  She runs inside and grabs some
 candy, then walks out.

 Lisa watches TV as Homer's mother leaves for work.  ``You should get a good job!'' she
 tells him.  The family walk into the house and sit outside, watching television.  Bart is
 standing in front of the TV, eating popcorn.  A woman in a bikini pulls away from Homer.  Itchy hands Homer a candy bar.
 Lisa asks if he'll like it, but Bart refuses to eat it.  Bart sits down and
 eats it.  ``No!'' he says, looking at the TV.  ``I'm just going to make sure I don't get sick.''  Smithers comes back to watch
 TV.  ``Good morning, Mrs. Simpson.  You're getting ready to leave for work today.''

 At home, Bart plays with a pacifier while Lisa and Marge look around.  ``Itchy's got this thing you can put on your face,''
 they say, ``and
 I think it might be fun to have a little extra sugar-sweetener for our new dog.''

 Burns calls Moe's Tavern, which sells candy.  ``Hey, wait, no!''
 Marge tries to stop Homer from playing by giving him a hug.
