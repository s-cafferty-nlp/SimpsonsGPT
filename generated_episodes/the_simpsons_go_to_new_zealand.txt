EPISODE TITLE: The Simpsons go to New Zealand

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Homer sits at his computer, watching the news.  He is greeted by a TV news report...
   
   Marge: I think you might like this story.  It's called ``The Simpsons Go to New York''.
   -- ``''
   
 Homer watches TV news, and he imagines himself in a room full of reporters.  He looks around, then
   sees that everyone has been taken away from the
   press.  Bart and Lisa are also gone.  (``Oh, well, maybe we should have gotten some
   time to relax.'')

 Homer reads the newspaper.  ``Hey, it's _good_ news for the family.  But I don't want to be the butt of
   jokes!''  He goes back to the front page, where he discovers that the headline is ``New York Press'',
   and the headlines read ``Homer Gets Ahold Of A Press''.  ``The New York Press''
   
   Homer: Well, what do you say?  You're fired!  I'll never get any press.  Now let's make sure you get out of here before we lose our
          freedom.''
            [a reporter walks up]
            Hey, man, you really didn't see anything funny on TV, did you?  You know, uh,
              something was wrong with your television, but now I'm going to have to watch
          a movie.
           [everyone laughs]
-- Bart, not so much in the present, 

Homer and Marge walk away from the house in a flash.

Marge: [in the present] Lisa, are you sure it's time for us to go into the shower?
 Bart: Oh yeah, no, I don't want to hear that, Mom.  I just want to talk about my new job, and how
            I feel like I've got a lot of work to do.
Homer: Mmm...yeah.
-- Marge, she knows he's right, 

The family sit outside, watching a movie.

             [Marge is wearing a wig.  Homer looks at her]
Homer: Mmm...no.
Marge: What about this one?
Homer: Uh...it's a big ol' movie about a guy who goes out and buys himself a new car.
-- Marge, she doesn't understand, 

Marge: Marge, you're always telling me things you don't want to hear, but what's the difference between this and "What's the difference"?
Homer: Well, it's a little different than "What's the difference"?
-- Marge, I'm not sure what to say, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 7:17]

Homer drives off with the family to the town square where they are going to see the movie.  At the next stop is a sign saying "Film festival".

Homer: You're going to the film festival?  Oh, OK, fine.  But we've got to get back here before the film festival starts.
-- Homer, the man who invented the film festival, 

At home, Homer watches TV with his parents while Marge walks in.

Homer: Mom, I think you're all wrong.  The festival was supposed to be for women.
Marge: Dad, it's just that I don't like the idea of women coming in and taking part in
            the festival.
Homer: No!  We have to go to the festival, or we'll be arrested.
-- Marge, the woman who made the festival, 

The kids sit on the couch.  Homer asks Bart to come with them.

Homer: OK, Dad, where are you going?  It's a big festival, and they're all so nice.
Marge: Oh, good.  Let's see, what's the word on the street?
Homer: [sighs] "Free festival"!  [runs up]
-- A little too far, 

Marge suggests they play a video game, but Homer insists they do it for fun.

Homer: Well, if there's something funny about the festival, I'd rather have it than a lot of people laughing than
        having sex.
Marge: And if there's something funny about the festival, I'd rather have it than a lot of people laughing than
       having sex.
Homer: You're right.  There's something funny about the festival, I'd rather have it than a lot of people laughing than
       having sex.
Marge: And if there's something funny about the festival, I'd rather have it than a lot of people laughing than
       having sex.
Homer: Yeah, well, I guess there's nothing funny about it.

The crowd is gathered outside the festival gate, and Marge says, "So many people are going to come!  We want to get out of here!"

Homer: All right, all right, you'll see what we can do.  Let's just get out of here."  The crowd cheers as he walks away.  Marge

is impressed by his work.  "Wow," she says, "this has been a long time coming."

Homer: [trying to calm down] Well, I'm sure it will, Lisa.  But we've gotta get out of here before we get into any trouble.
Marge: [trying to calm down] Well, I'm sure it will, Homer.  But we've gotta get out of here before we get into any trouble.
Homer: All right, all right, you'll see what we can do.  Let's just get out of here before _we_ get
       into any trouble.  [picks up a sign from inside]

At home, Homer plays with Maggie, who has her own miniature golf course.

 At home, Homer watches TV.  He reads the `News' section of the newspaper.
   
   Marge: We're going to have to go to the bathroom, and I think it's time to clean our house.
          [the water leaks from the sink]
         [a woman looks at him]
Marge: Well, I guess I'm just gonna make sure we don't get any more money by cleaning our house.
         [a man puts a towel over his mouth]
Homer: [reading the news] It's been an awful day for the Springfield Shopper.  And I want to assure everyone that everything is OK.
           Now if you will, please keep your head above water.
