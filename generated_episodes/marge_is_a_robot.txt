EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 [End of Act One.]

 Homer's robot appears, and Bart is pleased.

 Lisa leaves the house to get some rest.  At home, she
 gets up and goes downstairs for her night-time reading.  She notices that there is no sign of
 Lisa.

 Lisa wakes up at 2am, and walks over to where Maggie was sitting with her.  Itchy looks out the window and sees

Homer and Moe.  ``What are you doing?'' he asks, looking around.

 Homer answers `I'm in the kitchen.''

 Lisa comes upstairs to see Moe on the couch.  ``Hey, look, what happened?'' she says
 as they talk about their evening together.  ``That's it, Dad. You're going to have to go back to work tomorrow.  And I'll be
 working...[sighs]
              my job.''  (The next day, Moe arrives)

 In the living room, Bart talks to his parents about how things will turn out.  ``You know, we've been through hell together,'' he
 says, ``but now you're not so sure.''

 The kids watch TV from their bedroom window.  ``Well, here you go, Mom: this is all good news for everybody!''

 Bart sits down next to Marge, who watches TV while Homer plays.

          ...and then decides that he can't stand watching anything else.  He turns off the light.

-- Bart's new life, 

Homer walks past Lisa and looks around nervously.

Homer: Hey, you're not going anywhere tonight...I'm just taking a nap.
 Lisa: I know what you mean.
Homer: Oh, no.  No one will ever be able to stop me from doing this again.
 Lisa: What are you talking about?
Homer: Well, let's go get some sleep.
-- Not sleeping at all, 

Homer wakes up in bed with his head wrapped in blankets, surrounded by family.  The only thing left is a few cans of soda, which he eats as usual.

Homer: Dad, we need something to wake us up for tomorrow.
Dad: We got a good idea --
Homer: [sighs] Maybe they should have a little more time.
-- A bad idea, 

Homer gets back in bed.  As he tries to make sense of everything, he imagines his mother sitting on his lap with a pillow over her head.  "Oh, yeah," he sighs, "we'll see if she
can hold onto it."  She does so, but he has no choice but to turn off the lights.  It
        makes him feel like an idiot.
Homer: Mom, don't tell anyone about this!  I can't even get you to sleep.  I'm just going to
      go out and do something stupid.
Marge: You're not making me laugh!  Why should I?
Homer: [chuckles] Oh...no...I mean...you know what?  I've always wanted a little
         fun at work.
Marge: Well, Dad, we have some time for that now.  But first, let's talk about your birthday.  And then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...and then...
