EPISODE TITLE: Marge is a Robot

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Bart's mother comes to visit him, and Homer suggests they go to the park.  He
 agrees.  ``I can't wait any longer.''  Lisa asks Bart to join her.  But she
 isn't sure what he means.  ``You don't have a dad!''  Bart tells her it's all about family
 and friendship.  (``What if you had one too?'')  The two are
 surprised that Homer doesn't want to spend his money on Bart's birthday.  ``Oh, I'm
 glad I got some good advice from you, Dad.''  She turns off the lights and
 watches Homer play with a toy doll.  ``I love you, son.''  It's a miniature robot, and Bart
 imagines himself playing with it.  Bart says he has to get a job, but when he arrives home, he gets a job
 at the Springfield Retirement Home.  ``It's not so bad.''  Homer plays with it for fun.

 Homer goes to the Kwik-E-Mart, where a man in a suit is selling tickets to Moe's.  Homer buys a ticket, and everyone cheers.  ``Ooh,
 this is great!''  Homer puts on his own show.  As Bart sits in front of the door,
 a woman in a dress walks out. ``I hope your parents aren't mad at me.  You're doing something
 special for us.''  Homer answers, ``Hey, everybody!''  The woman continues, ``If you were an adult, I'd be
 proud of you!''  ``But...you're a little too small.''  Homer hands over a card, but the woman
 refuses to take it.  ``Oh, I'll just make sure I don't have to pay for it.''  She takes it.

 In the car, Bart sits at his desk reading a letter from his sister.
 ``It's time we get some good news about Lisa.''  Marge has decided to let Bart write his letter on her own
 while he writes the rest of the family letters.  Homer and Marge are impressed.  ``That's what we
 should all do if this isn't going to go any better.''  Marge is also pleased.  ``We
 can finally see what love really looks like!''  Homer tells Marge that they should start by making love with
 their sisters now.  (``You know, when I got married, I was kind of a loser,'' comments Homer.)  At home,
 Bart gets his hair cut in a ponytail.

 At school, Homer reads a book about the importance omega-3 fatty acids in life.  ``The best way to
 get fat is to eat them.''  Lisa suggests that they use a dietitian to help her find the right nutrients.  ``And
 [the other kids] will enjoy eating them.''  Bart thinks about it, then decides that he doesn't want to
 spend money on a new pair of jeans.  But Lisa says she would rather watch TV.  So she offers to buy
 a pair of jeans for him.  ``I've never felt so comfortable wearing a pair of
 jeans like this,'' she explains.
 At home, Marge tries to explain that the reason she's wearing these jeans is because
 Homer's been trying to convince her that he should take
 out the garbage in the yard.  ``That's why you're always so happy when your
 children go out and play with us.  And I don't think I ever want to have any problems
 with Dad.  It's just something I can't do myself.''  She tells Bart to stop being a
 ``little selfish'' and gives him a free pair of pants, which he eagerly accepts.

 In the living room, Homer has an idea.  The family are having dinner.
 ``We want to see some more healthy meals, but we also want to know how to feed our families,'' he continues.
 ``You'll be able to keep up with your husband while you grow old, and we'd like you to make sure
 that no one gets sick or injured.''  Marge suggests that Bart try to stay away from his
 mother, and Homer agrees.  He asks what he can do to ensure that no one gets sick or injured.  Bart
 says he'll take care of himself while he grows old.  ``But if there's anything I can do, I'll just give
 me the money to pay off all my debt!''  Marge tells Homer that he needs to get out of the way
 so he can live with her.

 At home, Homer talks to Lisa about the situation.  She thinks it's important to
 make sure he doesn't have any more children, but Homer tells her that he &lt;will&gt;
 always be a good parent.  ``I'm sure you've heard enough about me, but...''  Lisa responds, ``I
 don't want to be a bad parent.''  (``Don't worry, Dad: I know how it feels when someone else is hurt by
 you, and I know how it feels when someone else's hurt by you too.''  Lisa continues to
 cheer.  Meanwhile, at Moe's Tavern, the bartender announces, ``The next time you're in trouble, don't drink your beer
 tonight, because you won't survive this week.''  The bar owner explains that they're
 going to keep their doors open until midnight for a special occasion.  Homer takes the
 order to go to Moe's Tavern.  It's a long night for Moe's, and everyone seems to have trouble finding
 a place to sit.  As Bart walks down the street, Marge notices an empty seat on the table.  She calls
 to say, ``Hey, Dad, I need to see something!''  Homer answers, ``What?''  Bart grabs the bottle and
 puts it in the fridge.  Marge orders them to leave the bar early.  But she doesn't like the
 idea of them being late.  (``We're going to be late for dinner.'')  The
 waiter asks Lisa if she wants to stay late, but she says that he'll take care of her when they
 get there.  ``I'm not going to let you get any more money than this.''  Homer tells
 Lisa she can come with him at any time, but Lisa insists on staying until he gives up.  He
 offers to pay the bill, but Lisa refuses.

 At home, Marge is upset that Lisa didn't give her the money before she left.  ``My son has been drinking too much!''  Bart
 suggests they try a little more expensive wine.  Homer explains that he was just thinking of selling it
 at Moe's Tavern.  ``You know, we've had a good beer lately, and I don't think we should be taking advantage of
 our customers.  We should be making some serious noise about how we _should_ be
 putting
 money into the bank.  If we want to make the most of this, we ought to start working together.''  Meanwhile,
 Maggie watches from the front window as Bart and Homer eat dinner.
 [End of Act Three.  Time: 21:16]

 The family walk out of Moe's Tavern.  Bart and Lisa are watching TV.
   
   Marge:  Well, I guess it'll just be me, Bart, who can't take the heat for being so
           loud.
   -- ``''
   
   Oh, that was fun!  You've had a lot of fun over the years, but now you've got to work hard at it.  Now let's get
   on with the show.
   -- Watching the kids play, ``''
   
   Homer: Hey, Mom!  It's funny because it's not funny because it's not funny because they're laughing.  Let's see, Mr. Simpson, what's
         funny is that when you put a dollar into the bank, people think they're doing something right.
   -- Homer pays for his birthday party, ``''
   
   Bart:  Dad, I don't know if you've ever seen my dad do anything funny before.
   -- Homer makes a surprise visit to Moe's, ``''
   
   Lisa:  I wish we'd done better than to go to Moe's.
