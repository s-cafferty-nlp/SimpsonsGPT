EPISODE TITLE: Seinfeld goes to Springfield

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   Marge: Homer, I'm going to Springfield.  If you don't want me here, go home.
Homer: [panting] What?
-- A new beginning, 

The Simpsons visit Springfield Elementary School in search of their new teachers.

Homer: Oh, yeah.  And we have a new teacher!
-- The new teachers, 

At the school, Principal Skinner announces that they're getting rid of all the kids who didn't get into class.  Lisa and Maggie laugh nervously.  "You know how it is," she says, "I always do my best."  ``It's just like
your mother taught you.''  Bart sighs, then turns away.

  Marge: We're not coming back until we find out what happened to our old teachers.
Skinner: Well, maybe one day.  But this is your first time in public since I got pregnant.  You can stay with us forever.
Lisa: No!  It'll be over before I've even had sex.
Skinner: Yeah, well, no worries.  There's plenty of room for everyone.
-- All the better to make sure everybody has an equal chance of success, 

They leave, but there's only one person left: Mrs. Krabappel.  She tells her children about the new teachers.  They cheer as she leaves.  Meanwhile, at school, Bart and Lisa watch TV while
Lisa watches cartoons on a computer monitor.  Lisa asks if she wants to take them to the park.  Krusty answers, ``No.''  Bart takes off his hat and walks past the playground
and onto the lawn.  He sees Bart and Maggie sitting in front of the
garden, surrounded by miniature golf carts.  Homer tries to get them to stop, but they just sit there
watching.

 Marge: I'm sorry, Dad, but we don't have to do this.
Homer: [snatches it] We're going to go out for some exercise!
Marge: Oh no!  That's not what you mean when you say...you're doing something that makes your butt look good
              
Homer: It's so nice to see you again!
-- A little more self-esteem, 

Marge says her husband isn't getting along with him, so Homer goes over to the other side of the fence.  The two
go back down into the field, then head back up another fence.  They walk
to the picnic area, where the sun shines brightly.  As Homer runs towards it, he notices an old man walking around
with a big pile of dirt on the ground.  He looks like he might be carrying a large
wad of cash.  "What's this?" he asks as he grabs it.

Homer: This is my money," he tells Bart, and he tosses it aside.  Bart gets up and
runs away, leaving behind his wallet and a note saying, ``Don't forget to check your balance.''

 After the game, Homer calls Lisa, who offers to help him
 find a new job.  She suggests they spend time together, which she does.  When
they leave, Homer leaves to pick up his car, where he finds it parked outside of
 his house.  At school, Lisa is playing with her toy gun.  "I'm just taking my kids home,"
she says.  She walks in and sees Homer's face.
 "Homer!" she cries out.  The next thing she knows,
 she has a bullet lodged in her throat.  "You're not going to get shot at," she tells him.

Homer asks for his phone number, but Lisa answers, ``No one will call me that way,'' and
he hangs up.  A minute later, the family arrives at Springfield Elementary.
 Principal Skinner greets them, and Homer takes a seat.  As Marge watches from afar,
 Marge points out the sign on the wall: ``The first class of the day''.  Bart
 reads it aloud.  He looks up as Marge runs into the classroom.
 ``Hey, look what we've got here!''
 Marge smiles and waves, then turns around.  ``Look!  It's our birthday, so we don't have to wait too long for
 you guys.''  Homer opens the door, but Marge doesn't notice.  She grabs an open
 towel and puts it on top of his head, then pushes it back down.  Marge holds it close to
her forehead.  She screams and yells again, ``Moe!  You can do anything!''  But she
 manages to make it through the doorway without getting hurt.  Marge returns
 to the front row with Bart, Lisa, Maggie and Selma, and Homer continues to cheer.  "Homer," he
happens to say, "I'll be OK!"  He runs out of the house, but Bart is still
running away.

 Bart's car speeds off in a green truck, and Homer tries to get some attention.
 Bart drives past, and Bart looks over at him.  A woman sits behind a table
with her hands up.  The next thing Bart knows, the truck has been driven by another driver.
 It crashes into the side of the road.  Lisa rushes outside, yelling, ``What the
 hell happened?  What was I doing here?!''  The two men run around,
 laughing.  They look around, then see what appears to be a man driving erratically towards
the other cars.  (``Uh oh!')  ``Oh no!  [sniffs] Uh oh!''

 At home, Moe asks how long he's been driving, and Homer explains that
his wife had gotten sick from drinking alcohol for weeks before the accident.  ``She got very ill,'' he
says, ``and she never gave me any reason to believe this was all my fault.''  So they drive
back to their house, where Homer watches TV as Marge takes a bath.  When Bart wakes up, he sees the
witnesses staring blankly at him.  ``Whoa, whoa, wait a minute...''  Marge walks over to
them, and tells them to go to bed.

 Homer is in bed when Marge asks if there's anything she can do for him.  He grunts
at her, but Marge refuses to listen.  She explains that Homer needs to learn how to be
different from everyone else.  The kids are still asleep, and Lisa suggests
that they sit down next to each other.  "Homer!  What about you?  You're going to have to learn how to be different,"
she says.  "I don't know what I want to do," says Homer.

 In the kitchen, Homer eats breakfast with Lisa.  (Marge is not eating.)  Homer has
some difficulty getting his hair back together, so he tries to get a shave by putting on some
other makeup.  At school, Marge offers to help him wash it off.  ``Just give me a little water,'' she
scoffs.  But Homer doesn't like the idea.  ``You're always trying to look good without wearing makeup.
 And you'll never wear something better than a bikini.''  Marge goes
to the bathroom, and finds Lisa sitting in her bedroom reading a book of poems.

 Homer gets dressed in his underwear and comes out of bed.  He opens the door and notices
the two naked girls sleeping next to him.  Marge calls to say they were awake, and Homer looks around to see
heh he's got an extra pair of pants on.  ``Oh yeah, no need for a big one.''

 Bart walks up to the TV set, grabs it, and starts watching the show.  "Marge, this is _really_ funny,'' he exclaims,
but then he hears Lisa laughing at her.  ``I love you so much!''  She laughs maniacally.  The
show goes off without interruption, but Homer watches as Marge pulls down her
shorts.  ``Hey, I think I'm going to be having a hard time with that
dress tonight, huh?'' he groans.  Itchy says he'll take some time to get used to
her new outfit, but Lisa assures him she doesn't mind.  ``You're not wearing anything like that today.''  So
she does...and she finds herself sitting on the couch next to Marge.  ``Homer, can I come in tomorrow night?'' she asks
him, and he agrees.  They sit together, and Marge gives Homer the thumbs up.  ``Yeah, okay, let's go.''  Homer
tries to make eye contact, but Lisa tells him she won't leave until he
comes back, and she leaves them alone.  At home, Bart reads a poem about the family,
playing it over and over again.  ``It's pretty funny, isn't it?'' he sighs.  Then
a voice announces, ``We're here to talk about our wedding.''  Lisa sits in the front row
of the
family table, holding a picture of the couple.
