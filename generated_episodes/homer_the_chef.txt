EPISODE TITLE: Homer the Chef

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 In the kitchen, Marge tries to explain to Homer how he's not allowed to serve meat in
 the family.  ``Oh, we've got a problem with that guy!''  She asks him to take it easy on
 the kids, and Bart agrees.  ``We can always get rid of them at home.  But you're not going to be able
 to keep up with the pace.''

 At dinner, Lisa is trying to convince Bart that she should stay out of
 trouble.  ``I want you to see my son eat some meat.  He's just going to
 eat his vegetables right now.''

 The next day, Lisa is eating breakfast at home.  While Marge is busy cooking,
 Bart is having a hard time reconciling his feelings with her.  ``You know, I think I'm going to go to church
 tonight,'' she muses, and Homer has a change of heart.  Bart says, ``Hey, Dad, I don't think I _should_ be here...''  Marge
 tells Bart that she wants him to come back to church if she can help him.  Meanwhile, Bart sits in his room
 reading his book, watching TV.

 [End of Act One.  Time: 9:48]

 Homer watches the news.  "The boy who killed himself?" he asks.  Marge explains that he's
 going to try to figure out how to make money from his job.  ``He's an expert at this stuff.  You'll be
 going to have to pay for it yourself.''  (``Yeah, but I don't have the money to buy a new one.  It's like a lottery.'')

 At home, Bart eats a sandwich.  ``My stomach hurts so badly," he says.  Marge
 suggests he try something else.  Homer tells Bart that the only thing left to do is get out of bed.  But
 Marge warns him to stay up all night reading.  Bart takes advantage of the situation by
 ordering Milhouse to read the newspaper.  ``I think you're going to want to see it,'' he says.
 Lisa agrees, and they sit in bed.  They eat their lunch.  The family watch TV, and the kids' parents cheer.
 Bart has trouble keeping up with the rest of the family, but Marge reminds them that they've got to go to the
 school to learn about
 the science of aging.  He goes through the class's list of books, which reads, ``The Art of
 Living.''  Lisa thinks they should start reading again, but Bart insists they just have to
 read it
 every day.  As Bart sits down to write, Marge comes up behind him.  ``You know, I'm not sure we can
 afford this expensive book, but I'm going to have to take care of my own son.''  She turns
 on the light to turn off the television, and she notices her mother sitting next to her.  ``Hey, Mom!'' she exclaims
 as she puts the light back on.  ``Oh, good-bye, Mom!''  Lisa laughs evilly.  ``What was
 that for?''

 [End of Act Two.  Time: 20:04]

 In the living room, Homer and Lisa play a video game.  They are both playing `Ain't no one gonna die.'  It's an
 addictive video game, and it has lots of fun.  (It's funny because it's just a game.)
 But when Homer asks Lisa why they don't play it, she tells him it's so boring, and he imagines himself with a
 very big family.  So he plays `The Little Prince of
 Springfield' in the background.  The kids laugh, and Homer is impressed.  "So interesting!" he says.  ``This is the
 best thing I've ever seen."  He takes his hand to his lips, and he looks at the picture of Bart.
 ``I wonder what kind of guy would get such a kick out of that?"  ``Yeah, well, I guess you'll just have to learn
 how to play it.''  Homer reads from the `Guide to Fallout Boy' magazine.
   
   Oh, there's something about that little boy that makes me want to go to the movies.  He's got all the right
   qualities.
   -- Marge reads a magazine, ``''
   
   Marge, do you think you can read magazines?
   Well, if you've ever been in one, I'd bet you could learn some useful things
  about the world around you.
   And, uh, I'm not saying you're going to be able to read anything...except for the occasional
   book, but I don't believe that _you_ will.
   -- Lisa's first word of advice, ``''
   
   Marge, please don't make fun of yourself any more.  [pulls her arm back]
   Now, as long as you understand your responsibilities and respect your elders, this may sound a little like a good idea,
   but it's not.
   -- Marge, on Maggie's attitude, ``''
   
   It's not fair to everyone who is trying to kill us.  If they want to see us killed, we should try to find a way to live
   without them.
   -- The Simpsons visit Springfield Elementary, ``''
   
   You know, when I was younger, I used to think I had everything I needed.  But now, I think I've lost my
   sense of direction.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
   Marge, I don't want you to lose your sense of direction.  Maybe we can get some good work together.
   -- Principal Skinner, ``''
   
   Marge, if you're going to give us money, let's just get rid of the bad guys first!
   -- Bart, ``''
   
   Homer, what are you talking about?  [the doorbell rings]
   -- Lisa, ``''
   
   Mrs. Simpson, there's nothing wrong with getting money out of school.  I'm sure that all of us have a lot of fun at school.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
   Now, it's time to take our family to Springfield Elementary for some fun.
   -- Homer, ``''
   
   Well, kids, I hope we enjoy this week's festivities.  We're here because...
   -- Principal Skinner, ``''
   
   Oh, and by the way, I must warn you that Bart's not coming home yet.
   -- Grampa, ``''
   
   And as always, I wish we could spend more time together.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
   Mr. Simpson, what's the matter?  You've just made your first public announcement of
  his plans to become a cop.
   -- Bart, ``''
   
   Lisa:  Hey, hey, look at this!  This is the most exciting time in all of my life.
   -- Marge, ``''
   
   [Homer walks up to the window and sees Lisa on the ground]
   -- ``''
    
   Ms. K:  [reading a newspaper] ``I'm sorry Mrs. K, but we've been told that there was a
   `pregnancy' scare last night, and the baby has already begun.  If this proves any good, I'd be honored to have
   your support.  Thank you very much.''
   -- ``''
   
   Marge:  What are you going to do, boy?  Don't let the baby get away from you.
