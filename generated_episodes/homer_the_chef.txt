 EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 Bart's house is surrounded by empty lots and he can hear a car honking outside.  "Come in! Come in!" he yells as they
 walk up.  Inside, Bart has two kids, Maggie and Milhouse.  The
 children look at each other curiously, but are not impressed.  A few seconds later, Lisa
 says, ``Oh, my God, I'm so glad you're back.''  She turns on the lights.  It
 turns on the gas, and it explodes into flames.  Burns runs off with all four of them,
 including Moe.  Smithers tells Bart to get out of here, and he does so, and he does so.  At

the Simpsons' home, Homer tries to explain what happened to Springfield Elementary, but Smithers refuses to answer

 questions about how long it was since the fire started, which leads him to
 ask Smithers if he thinks the family should have been together more.  Smithers responds that they didn't need to be together
 longer than five years, but Smithers points out that Springfield wasn't built like this, and he wants to know
what happened to Springfield.  So Smithers explains that Springfield was built like this once when the city burned down
 Springfield Elementary.  But Smithers suggests they stay together.  Homer answers that he doesn't want to talk about it now.  And
he walks away, leaving everyone alone.  Then, he sees an older man standing next to a car with a sign reading ``Burn Down Springfield'',
and he's going to burn it up.  The old man says "Burn Down Springfield'', and smashes his
mouth on the side of the road.  Burns screams out, but Smithers tells him not to worry, because
the other kids won't be hurt.  Marge calls the police.

 Bart goes to the house, where Skinner has just been shot.  He looks around for the
fire alarm.  A fire is raging inside the house.  Lisa runs in, but she hears the
fire alarm go off and leaves.

  Bart: [walking into the house] I don't know what happened, Mom.  It's too early for me.
  -- Moe, ``''
  
 As Homer tries to escape from the burning house, Smithers approaches them and asks, ``What did you say?''
 Smithers: Oh, no, I said something stupid!  You're so stupid!  Just keep walking!''
  
 At home, Smithers watches cartoons of children playing.  One boy plays
with the ball and another with the bat while Homer plays with the stick.  He then puts the ball back onto the ground
and tosses it over the fence.  Smithers: What do you mean, `burn it up'?
     Smithers: Yeah, we'll have to see how long it takes to get rid of all these people who _are_
burning things down.  That's why you can't put your head in the sand and say "Burn it up!"
-- Burns' first words, 

Smithers tells Bart to go out there, but Homer refuses.  Lisa asks him if he is going to leave
 for a date.

 Bart walks through the crowd as Marge looks on.  She sees Burns walking by wearing a
bouncer-size suit, which she thinks looks like his underwear.  Burns explains that he has been
burning things down since he was six years old, so he must be getting
much worse.  ``I've got a lot of scars!''  Marge tries to explain, ``Oh, I'm sorry, but I don't want any more
stuff.''  But Homer says, ``You know what? We're gonna make sure you're clean.''  Burns goes outside
to look for the next one.  At Springfield Elementary, Moe introduces himself.  ``I am Moe Simpson, son of Homer Simpson.''  The
kids laugh uproariously.  Marge calls out, ``Bart Simpson, I think you're ready for something special.''  A
tender voice greets her.
 ``Moe Simpson, this is Moe Simpson, sir.  This is Moe Simpson, sir.  [gasps] Oh, my God, I love you.  You were just so sweet!
   -- Marge makes fun of Bart, ``''
   
 As Marge leaves, Homer opens the door to find Burns sitting at the kitchen table.  He
sighs and asks how he's feeling.

 The family walk into Burns' office.  Burns has been out of town for
 a week.  Lisa tries to cheer him up, but Burns tells her that he'll be back soon.  ``I've got a new plan
 to do!  And it's gonna take me some time to get here.''  But Burns says that there's nothing
else he can do until his next visit to Springfield.  So he heads off in his own way...
  
   Burns: Hey, don't worry about it.  Your dad is going to tell you all about what happened today.
        [Lisa walks over and grabs a piece of paper]
Homer: Well, then let's see if we can make our plans work.  We're not getting any money from Springfield yet.
 Burns: OK, fine, good-bye.  Let's go eat dinner together.
-- Not much will come of it, 

At home, Marge sits on the couch watching television with Lisa.  She looks tired.  When she goes to bed,
she imagines Burns talking to her like this.  "Hey, hey, look, Homer, look!"
Burns: Look, Dad.  I think I'm done eating dinner tonight.
Marge: Yeah, well, I guess you didn't have to sleep very long ago.
-- Good night, Marge, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 21:22]

 At home, Bart and Milhouse watch TV together.  They are sitting on a chair in front of a TV set.  The
TV shows ``Homer's Little Helper'', ``The Simpsons Movie'' and ``''
``''
  
   Now, what do you say to me?  Well, I don't know how to answer your question.  [pause] What is it that makes you want to tell me about yourself?
 Bart: Well, it's just...the same thing as when you talk to someone.  It was all my life!
Milhouse: You mean, there was one time I really wanted to see something special, then I lost my job?
Homer: No, but now I've been living here for five years and we're doing fine.  But maybe someday, I'll get back to the real world.
   -- Homer has been spending his free time, ``''
  
   Bart: That sounds great.  So why should anyone bother asking?  And if they can't afford it, why not give us an extra $500 to go out and
get some money ourselves?
   Homer: Because you're going to make me rich.
