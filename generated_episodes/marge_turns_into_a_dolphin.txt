EPISODE TITLE: Marge Turns into a Dolphin

EPISODE SUMMARY: 

   

 The Simpsons are in the backyard watching TV.

 Homer is watching television with Marge, when his parents come to visit him.  They're
 upset about their son's recent behavior.  (He's clearly not happy.)  ``I thought he was
 happy!''  Lisa says she can't help but feel sorry for him.
 Bart asks what they're going to do, and Maggie answers, ``To get rid of the
 dolphin.''  She then leaves the TV on her bed.  As she does so, she notices that the dolphins
 have been eating the carpet.  It's a good idea to leave it alone...
  
   Marge: I don't want to go to the dentist, but I think you should check out the dolphin exhibit.
   Bart: [reading a book] ``A dolphin's an ugly duck.  You've got to clean it up, Dad.''
   Homer: Oh, Mom, I hope this doesn't scare your son!
   Marge: Well, maybe we could just take him to see some other dolphin show.
           [everyone looks at each other]
   Bart: What's the dolphin?
   Marge: It's a little dolphin that has a big belly and a big head.  And it's pretty much like the one that ate
          all these people!  But it's also kind of a little bit of a fish.
   Bart: Oh, yeah, okay, I guess we'll just have to wait for the dolphins to eat them.
           [they start eating the carpet]
            [everyone cheers]
-- Homer's new toy, 

The two go out into the forest where they're greeted by a giant dolphin.  They run up to a tree and look around, but when they reach a tree, they see a huge pile of dead trees

on the ground.  The crowd chants "Dogs!  Doodily" as Homer walks away.

Homer: Hey!  Come on, guys!  I don't want you to die!  You gotta get outta here before I kill you.
-- Homer, in need of money, 

At home, Lisa watches TV with a cat watching TV with a cat in bed, which is sleeping on the couch.  She notices the
cat's paw sticking out of the bed.  "Oh, my," she sighs, "that's good!"  Her eyes widen.  She goes to the couch and grabs her cat.

Marge: [walking slowly towards the house] Dad, I think this is going to be the happiest day of my life!  I can't believe you
        got me so close to this thing!  Now let's make it stop!  I'm
      going to have to go inside now.
Homer: Mmm...I'll get him some treats, Mom.
-- Bart and Lisa talk about how they want to spend the rest of their lives, 

Homer walks past the house, looking around for his cat.  He spots Marge sitting on the couch, eating her sandwich.
Homer: Mmm...I don't want to spoil anything by making fun of yourself.  [walks off]
          [a large pile of chips falls from the ceiling into Homer's mouth, but he manages to pull himself up]
Homer: Oh, no!  There's something really wrong with your little girl.
         [he puts the chips in a bowl of cereal]
Marge: [thinking] What?
Homer: You know, maybe I should've just put them on the table before we had any more fun.
Marge: No, that's not _my_ idea.  It's _my_ idea.  Let's just eat it.
Homer: Well, I guess there's nothing wrong with eating something when you're trying to make fun of me.
Marge: But --
Homer: [trying to get rid of the chips] Oh, don't panic!  We'll be back to normal soon.
-- The family get together to play, "King-Size Homer"

The kids are all giddy about what they have to do.

 Lisa: Dad, Mom, I want you to give us one last chance at bonding.
Homer: Yeah, okay, OK, great!  I'm going to go out and buy some ice cream for my daughter.
-- Homer gets his wish, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 21:04]

Homer has taken his first steps into the kitchen.  He takes a bath.  Bart is still asleep, so he goes through a few dishes...
Homer: Marge, if you ever need help with your husband, I can talk to him.
Marge: And I'd like you to come down for dinner.
Homer: Ooh, nice!  Now you're getting ready to go out for dinner, and I can take the kids.
Marge: And now I can see where your father has gone.
Homer: Mmm, good.
-- Homer's new best friend, 

Homer looks around nervously.  A man with a gun walks up.  He tells him that he'll be back in his underwear, but it's
bad news to him because he knows Bart won't get any of them back.
Homer: [tosses his pants] Well, maybe you could use this as a diversion.  But don't let the other guy have the
           advantage.  If he does, we'll have to give him a big fat check.
-- Homer, "?"

Homer takes a bite out of his sandwich.  The man gives him a hug, then leaves.  ``I'm going to have to leave for school.  You know, I think it's time
for me to start looking for some sort of support.''

 Lisa arrives home, dressed in a red dress.  She sits on the couch, admiring the food she's eating.
She says her first words.  ``Happy birthday, Mrs. Simpson!''  She hugs Bart.  ``Oh, good night, Mom.''
 Bart turns to look at the family.  ``Hey, everybody, I've just got a problem with my dad.  He's
nervous about the kids.  We've all been thinking about how to make him feel better.''  Maggie
sighs. ``He's always worried about us.  So why don't we get some help from
our new neighbors?''  Marge asks Homer to explain his
situation.

 At home, Lisa plays with the TV set and talks to Bart.  She tells him that it's time to go to church.
 The kids cheer and sing, but Bart is too distracted by their music to listen to anything else.
 (Marge suggests they take a break.)

 At home, Marge makes the phone calls for the family.  Homer has no money and is worried about the money he's making.
 ``I'll be damned if I ever want to go to church again.''  But Marge assures him she won't have to.
 ``If you're going to church, I'm going to need a babysitter.  And I know I can't afford it.''  She goes into the bathroom and
 opens the door.  Homer walks in.  ``What do you think we're going to get here?''  Marge explains the
 house is so big and complex that it could destroy itself.  "We've got a little plan," she says, "to
save ourselves from being stuck together forever."  A sign outside reads, ``No pets, no toys.''  Bart
 looks out the window and sees Milhouse, dressed like a man.
