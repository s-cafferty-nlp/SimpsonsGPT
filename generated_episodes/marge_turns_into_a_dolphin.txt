 Bart and Patty watch the show together, enjoying their evening meal.  They then go to the pool for another drink.  When they return home, they see a dolphin swimming in the water.
  
  Moe: That's what we call dolphin sex.
Patty: Well, dolphins are not really called dolphins.
Homer: No, dolphins are actually called fish.
Patty: And if there's one thing that makes us all so happy, it's that our
       mouths are filled with dolphins.
Homer: Yeah, I know.
   Patty: Now, don't get me wrong, dolphins are great pets!  If you ever want to be a dolphin, just say no!
Patty:...and I'll take care of you, too.
Homer: [gasp] So, let's do something good tonight...
Patty: Just like last time.  It doesn't matter who comes out here.
Homer: [puzzled] What?
Patty: Let's have some fun, OK?
Homer: We could even play hooky.
