The scene opens with Homer, Bart and Lisa on the couch.  The family watch TV.

 Marge: [on the phone] Mom!  I'm so proud you're here!
Homer: Oh, it's wonderful to see you again!  It's been a pleasure to be home, and now we can finally get
        our
                 wedding.
Lisa: [on the phone] Dad, don't panic.  There's something very special happening...
Homer: Oh, honey, that's sweet!  It's been such a pleasure to have you around for me.
-- Mmm, good-bye, "Who Shot Mr. Burns?  Part Two"

Homer walks up to the house, but is met with a loud crash.  He rushes into the bathroom, where Marge tells him he's going to have to wait
to find out what happened.

Homer: Hey, Marge, just relax, let me just say this: I've got some serious problems at work.
-- You'll need it when they start working, 

Homer goes over to the kitchen to pick up his things.

 Marge: [on the phone] I know there's a big deal about your father's death, but I think it's important
           to remember that you &lt;really&gt; didn't die alone.
Homer: [on the phone] What's wrong?
Marge: I want to go to the doctor right away, but she says you won't be able to
        take us out of here until we get a good one.
Homer: Oh, OK.  But what if...you're going to have to leave for school tomorrow?
Marge: It's all about the money.  And _that_ is where it gets tricky.
Homer: [reading] Don't forget your parents' names!  They've been so helpful.
Marge: Yeah, sure, they've had their ups and downs, but this is where they're most important.
Homer: Well, I can't wait to see them again!  So let's just say it's not easy.
Marge: Dad's been great to me, Lisa.  He's been my friend for years.
Homer: All I can really ask for is a hug, and I'm happy we're in school together.
Marge: I guess you could say that's all part of being human.
Homer: [reads] Don't forget your parents' names!  They've been so helpful.
Marge: Oh, yeah, well, I can't wait to see them again.
Homer: Homer, please don't forget your parents' names.
Marge: [reading] Don't forget your parents' names!  They've been so helpful.
Homer: Mmm...
-- Homer and the Simpsons, 

Bart sits on the couch with Maggie, who has trouble sleeping.

 Bart: Dad, you're going to miss me!  You have such a big heart.
Homer: [reading] Don't forget your parents' names!  They've been so helpful.
Marge: Well, they always were --
Homer: OK, but I don't know if they'll ever forgive you.  And I don't want to be alone.
Marge: Lisa, I think it's time to give up my love for you.
Homer: But first, you must remember that this will never happen again.
-- The best way to get away from this family, 

The next day, Homer walks out of bed.  "Dad, don't forget your parents' names!" he cries, but Maggie is too tired to do anything.
Homer: Now, kids, let's not forget our families!  They've been so helpful.
-- Homer's plan to save money, 

Lisa takes off her dress.  Homer asks what she's wearing.
Homer: Mom, I hope you don't wear anything else.
Lisa: No, Dad, no, Dad, just keep your head down and don't talk about stuff.
Homer: [laughs] You can't go anywhere without a good excuse.  We'll never know how
        it all went down.
-- Lisa's first words after Bart leaves, 

Bart has the family on his way home, and Marge tells them they're going to see the psychiatrist.

Homer: Well, that's _me_, Marge.  But I'm still worried about the things you did
        last night.
-- A little more time, huh, 

The next day, Marge sits at the breakfast table with Bart, who is eating a ham sandwich.
Homer: Mmm...it's nice to meet you, Marge.
Marge: I love you, Dad.
Homer: Mmm...I think you'd be proud to say that.  And I really think you should get some
           attention from the rest of the family.
Marge: I am, Marge.  If we had any friends, we could always find one that was
          right for us.
Homer: Mmm...I thought I was gonna say something sweet, but I didn't want to make it sound like I
          did anything wrong.
-- Not _ever_ going to stop loving you, 

Homer: [whispers] Don't worry, Homer.  I know you've been thinking about this a lot, but I just can't take it any more.
-- You're not going to listen to me now, 

Homer walks into the kitchen, and sees his parents' house.  Bart is standing in front of the stove, with a book in his hand.
Homer: Oh, Marge!  What kind of books are you writing?
Marge: Well, uh...a little romance stuff, yes, but there's a few things I don't have.
Homer: [reading] The best part is, you never know when you'll get back.
Marge: Well, I guess you will, son, but first we'll need to get you a new pair of pants.
Homer: All right, Marge, I'm glad you're coming home, but what if we go to school again?
-- No, you won't, 

Homer: Mom, I think I'm getting a little too attached to your new clothes.  They look so much alike, and I can't believe they're
      made out of the same material.
-- Homer's new outfit, 

[End of Act Two.  Time: 21:22]

At Moe's Tavern, Lisa tells Bart that she was just thinking about how to pay for her new pair of pants.

Lisa: Hey, Dad, there's a whole lot of money in this house.
Homer: And it's going to be fun!
        [a waiter walks past with a tray of cash]
-- A little more than half a million dollars?  It's not like we've ever had any problems, 

The next day, at Moe's, Bart tries to explain that he got his idea from a friend who was selling
                      cheap clothes.
