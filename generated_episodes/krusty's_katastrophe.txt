 EPISODE SUMMARY: 

 [End of Act Three.  Time: 14:16]

 In the present, Homer is sitting at a table with his parents watching television.  He looks up at them from the TV and smiles...
   
   Hey Dad!  You know, it's not like we're all in this together.  We've been through so much together.
  -- Lisa tries to get her father to take her on a date, ``''
  
  Marge: I'm sure you can tell by your reaction that he was right.  Well, I guess you'd think he would have known
      what she meant.
Homer: What?  Why don't you go sit down and watch some more TV?
-- Bart has a hard time reconciling himself to being alone with Lisa, 

Lisa: Oh, no.  It's too good an excuse to be here.  And now, let's just pretend we haven't seen each other for a minute.
Homer: All right, fine.  Now look, kids, if there's any reason to be sad, then do something about that.  That way, we'll never have to live apart again.
  
  Lisa:  OK, but why am I saying that?  Because you really are my best friend, and I want you to understand how
        I feel about you.
Homer: Aw, sorry.  But you mustn't forget our family history.
 Lisa: No, Dad.  Just stay away from me.  I mean, we both need
          love, but we're going to have to figure out what happens next.
 Bart: [sighing] You know, that's the only way I can save myself.  And I think we should be
      alone together.
-- The last straw, 

Lisa is at work, watching TV, as a man approaches her with a large baggie of food.

 Homer: What happened to those two little kids?
Marge: They were so cute!
Homer: That was just...
Marge: Well, they ate their lunch in the cafeteria, and then they got into bed
         and started crying uncontrollably.
-- A sad ending, 

Homer watches cartoons on TV while Marge tries to explain the situation.

 At school, Principal Skinner asks if he'd like to see Homer play the saxophone.  ``I dunno''
          "what's wrong with his saxophone?"
Skinner: Oh, no, it's not good music.  It's bad for you.
        [everyone applauds]
Skinner: So what do you say, boy?  If this guy could sing, wouldn't you?
Homer: Heh, well, let's all go get him some beer and eat some dinner.
-- Homer has to admit, the most important thing to ever happen to him, 

[End of Act One.  Time: 13:48]

 The kids watch TV together as Homer sings "The Good News Bears".

 Bart walks in with a box of candy.  Marge asks, ``Hey!''
Marge: Hey, Dad.  You're looking at me like I'm crazy!
Dad: Oh, no.  I just don't want to hear it.
Lisa: But that's OK, Dad.  We can make up our own minds about this one time.
Bart: And then we'll have a new family.  That way, everyone will be happy.
-- What are parents supposed to say when they think their children are going nuts?, 

Marge tells Lisa she needs a babysitter.  She suggests giving her two dollars for each child to spend with
 Maggie.  They laugh happily while Lisa watches TV.  Bart calls out ``Oh, my God, Mommy, there's so much more to life than this.''

At home, Homer sits on his couch watching television.  A picture of himself is playing on TV.  Marge
 laughs uproariously.
Homer: Aw, Mommy, here's the deal -- if you don't tell me where to look, I'd never guess your name.
-- Now you know how to play, 

Homer gets off the couch and starts talking to Marge.  She turns around and sees a cartoon of him playing
with his dog.  Marge is pleased.

Marge: [on TV] Dad, it's true!  He was just going to go into the garage with some friends.
Homer: Oh, good luck finding that one!
Marge: And there's another one in the house too...
Homer: Yeah, OK, now we can get back together.
-- Bart finds out what happened, 

[End of Act Three.  Time: 14:48]

 Homer goes to bed, but Marge tells him he'll have to watch "The Simpsons Movie" at night.  The two are having an affair.  Lisa wakes up early to find
her father asleep on the couch.  ``I'm so sorry, Dad, I thought you were asleep.''

 Homer watches the show from the bedroom window.  Marge asks for help sleeping next to her son.  When she opens the curtains,
she sees Homer sitting alone in bed, watching cartoons.  She calls 911, then runs upstairs to call Homer, who arrives at
the hospital.  Marge orders Homer to wake up, but he refuses.  A doctor comes by, who suggests that he sleep in
his room.  Marge tries to explain, ``Heh, maybe not.''  Homer responds, ``Just make sure you're awake.''

 At home, Marge takes Homer to see Dr. Hibbert, who says he has a brain tumor.  (``A brain tumor?'')

 In the morning, Homer is taken to a psychiatric ward.  He gets a blood transfusion from his father.  Bart and Patty
 are asleep on the couch.  They look at each other as Homer's eyes roll over.
 ``I'm going to get my pacemaker!''  Lisa asks for her pacemaker.
 But she can't remember what it was...
 ``That pacemaker saved me,'' she cries.  ``Oh, well, I guess we'll all be fine.''  She calls back again.
 The next day, they have a baby boy named Moe.  ``It's been so hard for him, but he's
 getting better!'', they say, ``and now we can go out with him.''  And so does Moe.
 ``Moe, this pacemaker should give you some hope of being healthy!''  He runs up to them and starts playing
 with himself.  ``Well, if only there were something more than a pacemaker, eh?''
   
 Meanwhile, Marge goes to see a psychiatrist.  "You know, just one thing: your pacemaker will help you
 survive," she tells him, ``but you won't feel good about yourself."  Marge sighs, ``I think it's time we started doing something together.
 It's been an awful couple of weeks since I got sick.''  Marge looks at Marge.  ``And I don't want to do anything else.''

 On the way to the hospital, Homer sees the news that his father has died.  Lisa is sitting next to her and she asks Bart if he can help
 find a new name for him.  ``Well, I'll be sure to give you one,'' says Bart.  ``Just like
 your mother did.''  ``Good luck.''  The two walk off in the car with Bart.  (``Homer!'')
 They return to Springfield Hospital.  At home, Maggie walks up to Bart who is on the couch talking to Homer.
 ``Hey, what's going on?'' she asks him.  He answers, ``It's just a bunch of people trying to get me to
 take care of myself.''  ``You're not supposed to go out there...'' he continues, but Marge refuses to listen.
 She tells Homer that she doesn't have any friends outside of Homer, but then goes inside.  ``What am I supposed to do?''
 ``Don't worry, Dad, this will work.''  Lisa suggests that Homer should tell her how much money he makes each day.
 Bart agrees, and they leave the house.  Bart calls from the other side of town.  "Marge, are you OK?"
 ``Yeah, fine," she replies.  Then she grabs a bottle and starts drinking.  ``Oh, come on, man, look!  You _got_ my back.''  She takes it
 away, leaving Maggie alone.  But when she comes down, Homer notices her hair.
