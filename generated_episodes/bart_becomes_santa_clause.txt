EPISODE SUMMARY: 
[Syndication cuts are marked in curly braces "{}" and are courtesy of

At the Simpson home, Lisa and Maggie watch a movie.

   Lisa: Dad, I think you'll be fine.  You've got some great ideas for your new life.
Homer: [scoffs] Well, that's good enough for me.
-- A good idea, 

Lisa asks what she should do about Mr. Burns' gambling addiction, ``''

She then goes to the TV, where Homer is playing with a miniature golf course.
 (``What?'' asks Marge.)  The golfer is on the other end of the table.  ``You want to play at the
Simpson golf course?''

The family sits around the kitchen table, watching a cartoon.  Homer tries to make a point, but Marge
 says it's too much for him.
   
   Homer: Now I know we all have our faults...but there are times when we _are_ better than others.
   -- Bart's advice to Bart, ``''
   
   Bart: And now, here's my plan: If you don't play, I'll give you a free golf course!
   -- ``''
   
   Homer: Oh, okay, OK, let's just get rid of those lousy kids.  But I'd like to see if we can find something
   fun for them.  They're really nice people.
   -- Marge, ``''
   
   Marge: I'm glad they came to the Simpson house.  Let's go play.
   Homer: No way, Mom!  We need money!
   Marge: [walks in] Hey, what are you going to do?
   Homer:  Get outta here!
   Marge: What?
   Homer:  I want to play with my friends.  You know, it's good to have someone who knows how to take care of
   his own butt.
   Marge: Well, maybe I could get some money back, but I've got an idea.
   Homer: Yeah.
   Marge: It's time we put a stop to this madness.  The Simpson house is becoming a cesspool
            of misery.
   Homer: [tosses up]  Don't you think that would be nice?
   Marge: Well, maybe we should leave the house, and let it be known that no one will ever
                  hurt me again.
    Homer: That's all right, Mom, but I guess we're _really_ going to have to start thinking about
               things before we get out of here.
    Marge: You know, Lisa, there's always the temptation to go crazy.
           [the family walk in]
           [they look at each other]
          [the children laugh uproariously]
          [everyone laughs]
           [a car pulls up behind them]
-- Bart, the man of action, "King-Size Homer"

At home, Marge sits on the couch.  She thinks about what she has done, then tells Bart to watch TV.  ``I don't want to
          see any more of those horrible kids who eat themselves like
         meatloaf!''

 At bedtime, Maggie wakes up with an alarm clock reading 7:00 AM.  She turns off the light to turn
         the radio.  It's 9:30 AM, and she's got the best news of the day.  The
            school
             is over.  Lisa is in the kitchen, watching a television program, while Homer watches the
         Springfield Retirement Home.
   Homer: [reading] I have a feeling it's going to be a long day for me, Dad.
Marge: [sighs] I wish I was dead, but I'm not.  You know, I've always been a little worried about things,
         but lately I've gotten better at taking care of myself.
Homer: Well, you know, now that we're all adults, there's nothing wrong with being happy.
           [Lisa looks at Bart]
Marge: Now I know I'm supposed to take this job --
Homer: Oh, well, okay.  But...
         [they go to breakfast]
-- No need for a lot of fussing, 

Homer decides he'll make his own decision.  He goes to the library.
              [everyone cheers]
         [Homer opens the door and sees everyone in the cafeteria]
Homer: [on the phone] Hello?  How are you?
         [Everyone smiles]
        [Homer walks into the hall]
Homer: [reading from an article] The good doctor has said, ``If you don't get it, you may die.''
-- Homer is no longer a patient, 

Homer: Hey, hey!  You can read your own medicine.  And if you want to learn about how to use a pacemaker, I have some ideas.
-- A simple but effective way to get rid of the germs, 

The next day, Marge is reading from a pamphlet on the subject.  She asks Lisa to write a letter.

Marge: Dad, you should check out my new book on germs.
Homer: Yeah, yeah.
           [he writes "Bart's germs"]
-- Not much of a surprise, 

At home, Homer reads the pamphlet.  His first line is, ``If it doesn't work, then it won't work.''

Homer: [reading] If it doesn't work, then...then...then...then...then...then...then...then...then...
-- Bart's germ theory, 

In bed, Homer tells Marge he wants to start using a pacemaker.

         [Marge puts her arm around Homer] Mom, this is not going to work!
-- No pacemaker, 

Homer takes a nap in bed and wakes up with a big sigh.  He looks up at his pillow.
-- You're lucky to be alive, 

Marge goes into her room to read the pamphlet.  The next morning, Marge has a dream: she dreams that Bart will eat something
that makes her feel good.

Marge: Homer, if you don't want to eat, then we can't go to the movies.
Homer: But we can't go to the movies.
-- And what if Bart doesn't want to go?  It'll cost $50,000, 

Homer tries to explain himself.
